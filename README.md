Modeling Smart Inverters in Distribution Optimal Power Flow

A smart inverter does not accept a reactive-power set-point. It follows a Volt-VAr
curve, deciding from its own terminal voltage how much reactive power to inject or
absorb. An OPF that ignores that curve returns a dispatch the inverter is never going to
deliver. This package puts the curve inside the optimisation, three different ways, and
runs each of them against four distribution OPF host models: two single-phase, two
three-phase, linear and near-exact in each pair. The encodings agree; the hosts do not,
and an exact AC power flow decides between them.

## Prerequisites

### Getting Julia

This package requires **Julia 1.10 or newer**, and is tested on 1.10 and on the current
release. If you do not have Julia yet, install it with
[juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup), or via the
[Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9NJNWW8PVKMN) (or
`winget install julia -s msstore`) on Windows, or with
`curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh` on macOS and Linux.

Alternatively, take an installer from
[julialang.org/downloads](https://julialang.org/downloads/).

### Choosing an environment

Julia installs packages into an *environment*, and a fresh environment starts out empty.
Plain `julia` uses the shared default environment; `julia --project=.` uses the one
described by the `Project.toml` in the current directory.

Every folder in this repository that runs code ships its own `Project.toml`, so its
dependencies are already declared and one command installs them. From the repository
root:

```bash
julia --project=examples/single_phase -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.develop(PackageSpec(path=".")); Pkg.instantiate()'
julia --project=examples/three_phase  -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()'
julia --project=scripts               -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.develop(PackageSpec(path=".")); Pkg.instantiate()'
```

The `Pkg.develop` step is there because those environments depend on this package, which
is not in the registry; the three-phase scripts are standalone and do not need it. The
sections below matter mainly when you are assembling an environment of your own.

### Packages

`SmartInverterDOPF` is not in the General registry, Julia's default package catalogue,
so it has to be installed from its Git URL:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(url = "https://github.com/ra-emami/SmartInverterDOPF.jl")
```

All the other packages are in the General registry, so they can be added by name:

```julia
Pkg.add(["JuMP", "JSON3", "Plots"])                             # modelling, data, figures
Pkg.add(["Printf", "Markdown", "LinearAlgebra", "Statistics"])  # standard library
```

| package | what it is for |
|:--|:--|
| `JuMP` | the modelling layer every formulation on this page is written in |
| `JSON3` | reading the feeder, load and irradiance files, and the committed results |
| `Plots` | every figure |
| `Printf`, `Markdown` | formatting the printed output and the tables |
| `LinearAlgebra` | the 3×3 phase impedances in the three-phase scripts |
| `Statistics` | the test suite |

The last four ship with Julia, but a project environment still has to add them before
`using` will find them. Make sure all of this is installed in the same environment you
run the code from. `Pkg.status()` lists what the active environment already has, and a
`using` line that raises `ArgumentError: Package X not found` means `Pkg.add("X")` has
not been run for it.

### Solvers

Two of the three encodings produce a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) and need an MILP
solver; the third produces a nonlinear program (NLP) and needs an NLP solver. Both
solvers used here are in the General registry:

```julia
Pkg.add(["Gurobi", "Ipopt"])
```

| encoding | model class | solver used here |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `:bigm`, `:lambda` | MILP | Gurobi |
| `:heaviside` | NLP | Ipopt |

Gurobi is commercial and needs a licence in place before `Gurobi.jl` will build, and is
[free for academic users](https://www.gurobi.com/academia/academic-program-and-licenses/).
Ipopt is open source and needs no licence, so the `:heaviside` route runs with no
commercial software at all.

> **On open-source MILP solvers.** We also tried HiGHS and GLPK on this model and neither
> worked out: one returned an infeasible status inside the successive-linearisation loop,
> the other was too slow to finish. The committed results use Gurobi. If no MILP licence
> is available, the `:heaviside` encoding needs only Ipopt and reaches the same answer.

The tutorial's
[Prerequisites](https://ra-emami.github.io/SmartInverterDOPF.jl/dev/tutorial_voltvar/#Prerequisites)
section covers the same ground.

## Quick start

```julia
using SmartInverterDOPF, Gurobi

case = load_case()
res  = solve_dopf(case, Gurobi.Optimizer; method = :lambda)   # host = :ivacopf (default)

kWh(case, sum(res.PVC))     # PV energy curtailed over the day, kWh
extrema(res.V)              # voltage range across the feeder, p.u.
```


## The single-phase host models

`method` picks how the droop curve is encoded; `host` picks the network model it sits
inside. They are independent: the droop constraints are identical in both hosts.

| `host` | model | accuracy | solve |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| `:ivacopf` *(default)* | current-voltage AC-OPF ([doi:10.1109/OJIA.2024.3367547](https://doi.org/10.1109/OJIA.2024.3367547), extended in [doi:10.1016/j.epsr.2026.113613](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsr.2026.113613)) | very accurate, near-exact AC | **iterative**: re-linearised until the residual of the exact power-flow identity clears a tolerance |
| `:lindistflow` | linearised branch flow ([doi:10.1109/SMARTGRID.2010.5622021](https://doi.org/10.1109/SMARTGRID.2010.5622021)) | approximate: losses dropped, small voltage deviations assumed | run **once**, much faster and far lower computational effort |

```julia
solve_dopf(case, Gurobi.Optimizer; method = :lambda, host = :lindistflow)
```

> **Use `:ivacopf` for quantitative work.** Audited against an exact AC power flow on the
> bundled case, the IVACOPF dispatch reproduces the true solution to ~1e-9 p.u. and sits
> on the droop curve to ~1e-7. The LinDistFlow dispatch is off the droop by 6% of
> inverter rating and puts 17 of the 96 time steps below the lower voltage limit, so it
> is not deliverable. `:lindistflow` is for a fast first look and for warm-starting.

The cheap host also makes the accurate one cheaper. `warm_start = :lindistflow` seeds
the IVACOPF linearisation from the LinDistFlow solution instead of a flat profile, which
halves the passes and is ~1.7× faster overall, for the same answer:

```julia
solve_dopf(case, Gurobi.Optimizer; method = :lambda, warm_start = :lindistflow)
```

## The three encodings

The Volt-VAr law is a five-segment piecewise-linear function, a definition by cases,
which is exactly what a solver cannot read. Three standard rewrites make it tractable:

| `method` | class | idea | needs |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| `:bigm` | MILP | one binary per segment activates that segment's voltage window and affine law | MILP solver |
| `:lambda` | MILP | operating point as a convex combination of breakpoints, SOS2 forcing adjacency | MILP solver |
| `:heaviside` | NLP | segment masks from unit steps, summed into one closed-form expression | NLP solver |

All three are exact and, on the bundled case study, return the same dispatch to within
solver tolerance. They differ in the solver technology they demand and in how they scale
with inverters × time steps.

## Case studies

Three feeders, all over 24 h at 15-minute resolution (96 steps), all minimising PV
curtailment, all with voltages held inside `[0.95, 1.05]` p.u.

| feeder | phases | size | inverters | used for |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| IEEE 33-bus | single | 33 buses | 3, at buses 7 / 18 / 33 | the main case study; the package's `load_case()` |
| `network_5_Feeder_2` | three | 194 buses, 18 single-phase loads split 4/5/9 | 12 in four size classes, 84 kW | the three-phase case study |
| `network_17_Feeder_6` | three | 3856 buses, 223 single-phase loads | 12 | the scalability check |

Both three-phase feeders are real Electricity North West low-voltage networks, Kron-reduced
to three wires; sources and licence are in
[`examples/three_phase/README.md`](examples/three_phase/README.md).

Headline results, all three encodings agreeing to solver tolerance within each host:

| case | host | curtailed | droop residual at the **true** AC voltage |
|:--|:--|--:|--:|
| 33-bus | IVACOPF | 3022.0 kWh | 7.9e-08 |
| 33-bus | LinDistFlow | 60.5 kWh | 6.1e-02, **not deliverable** |
| 194-bus | IVACOPF | 42.69 kWh | 2.8e-11 |
| 194-bus | LinDist3Flow | 46.32 kWh | 8.0e-03 |

The last column is the test that separates the hosts: take each dispatch, solve the exact
AC power flow for it, and ask whether the inverters would really have produced those VArs.

## Repository layout

```
src/                    the package: case data, droop encodings, DOPF hosts
data/                   IEEE 33-bus feeder, load profiles, solar profile (JSON)
scripts/                generate_results.jl: recomputes the single-phase results
examples/single_phase/  6 standalone scripts: {ivacopf,lindistflow} × {bigm,lambda,heaviside}
examples/three_phase/   6 standalone scripts: {LinDist3Flow,IVACOPF3Ph} × {BigM,Lambda,Heaviside}
                        plus generate_results.jl, scalability.jl, plot_network.jl
docs/                   Documenter site; builds without any solver
test/                   test suite
```

Every standalone script is self-contained and shares its skeleton verbatim with its
siblings, so a `diff` between any two shows only the droop block, or only the network
model.

## Three-phase examples

[`examples/three_phase/`](examples/three_phase) runs the same three encodings on a real
unbalanced LV feeder, against **two** three-phase hosts:

| | Big-M | Lambda / SOS2 | Heaviside |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **LinDist3Flow**: multiphase linearised branch flow, one pass | `LinDist3Flow_BigM.jl` | `LinDist3Flow_Lambda.jl` | `LinDist3Flow_Heaviside.jl` |
| **IVACOPF**: three-phase current-voltage AC-OPF, successive linearisation | `IVACOPF3Ph_BigM.jl` | `IVACOPF3Ph_Lambda.jl` | `IVACOPF3Ph_Heaviside.jl` |

```bash
julia --project=examples/three_phase examples/three_phase/IVACOPF3Ph_Lambda.jl
```

Feeder, horizon and fleet come from the environment (`TP_CASE`, `TP_STEPS`, `TP_NPV`, and
for IVACOPF `TP_WARMSTART`, `TP_TOL`, `TP_MAXITER`, `TP_IMAXSEG`), so the same model runs
on a different network without editing anything.

### Does it scale?

`scalability.jl` reruns the LinDist3Flow scripts on the 3856-bus feeder. The mixed-integer
encodings carry a 3.3-million-variable model over the full day in about a minute, and the
binary count does not move between feeders: it depends on inverters × time steps, not on
network size. The integer-free encoding is the one that breaks: Ipopt gives up at the full
horizon and needs a shortened day to finish. All three stay exact wherever they finish.

## Regenerating the documentation results

The documentation is built from precomputed results committed under
`docs/src/assets/results/`, so building the docs needs no optimisation solver. To
recompute them:

```bash
julia --project=scripts scripts/generate_results.jl
```

and, for the three-phase section, which runs all six scripts, both hosts:

```bash
julia --project=examples/three_phase examples/three_phase/generate_results.jl
```

`TP_HOSTS=ivacopf` or `TP_HOSTS=lindist3flow` regenerates one family only.

## Building the documentation

```bash
julia --project=docs -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.develop(PackageSpec(path=pwd())); Pkg.instantiate()'
julia --project=docs docs/make.jl
```
