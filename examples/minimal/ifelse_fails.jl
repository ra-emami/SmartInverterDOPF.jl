#  Why "if-else" cannot go straight into a solver
#
#  The IEEE 1547 Volt-VAr curve, written as a Julia `if`-`else` and handed to a solver.
#  That is the whole example: no network, no OPF, no data, nothing to download but JuMP.

    println("""

  `v` is a decision variable, not a number. The solver has not chosen it yet, so
  `v <= 0.90` has no truth value to branch on and the body of the `if` never runs.
  Branching is not an algebraic constraint, and rewriting the `if` does not change that.

  The curve has to be handed to the solver whole, as algebra. That is what Big-M,
  Lambda/SOS2 and Heaviside each do, in examples/single_phase and examples/three_phase.
