# Embedding the Volt-VAr droop into a distribution OPF

*Rahmat Emami Mirak — supervised by Dr. Adedoyin Inaolaji*

A smart inverter does not accept a reactive-power set-point. It follows a Volt-VAr
curve: it measures its own terminal voltage and decides, on its own, how much reactive
power to inject or absorb. An optimal power flow that ignores that curve will happily
return a reactive dispatch the inverter is never going to deliver.

This tutorial shows three ways to put the curve *inside* the optimisation, so that every
dispatch point the solver returns is one the inverter would actually produce. All three
are exact — none of them approximates the curve — and on the case study below all three
return the same answer. What separates them is the solver technology they demand and how
they scale.

## Prerequisites

Julia with [JuMP](https://jump.dev), a mathematical-programming solver, and this
package. Two of the three methods produce a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) and need
an MILP solver; the third produces a nonlinear program (NLP) and needs an NLP solver.

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(["JuMP", "Gurobi", "Ipopt"])
Pkg.add(url = "https://github.com/ra-emami/SmartInverterDOPF.jl")
```

!!! note "Solvers used here"
    Everything on this page was produced with **Gurobi** for the two mixed-integer
    encodings and **Ipopt** for the nonlinear one. Gurobi is commercial, but
    [free for academic users](https://www.gurobi.com/academia/academic-program-and-licenses/).

    We also tried the open-source MILP solvers **HiGHS** and **GLPK** on this model.
    Neither worked out — one returned an infeasible status inside the
    successive-linearisation loop, the other was too slow to finish. Use Gurobi.

    If no MILP licence is available at all, the `:heaviside` encoding needs **only
    Ipopt**, which is open source, and reaches the same answer — a practical reason to
    care about an integer-free formulation quite apart from the theory.

## Why the curve has to live inside the OPF

IEEE 1547-2018 [[1]](#ref-1) requires every interconnecting distributed energy resource (DER) to be
capable
of Volt-VAr control. The utility enables the function and sets the curve; the inverter
then runs it autonomously as a local feedback law. An advanced distribution management
system (ADMS) can coordinate hundreds of these inverters through a distribution optimal
power flow (DOPF) — but only if the DOPF knows the law each one is following.

Leave the curve out and the OPF treats ``q_i^G`` as a free decision variable inside the
inverter's apparent-power circle. It will pick whatever value minimises the objective.
The inverter, meanwhile, is looking at its own terminal voltage and producing something
else entirely. The dispatch is not merely suboptimal; it is not physically realisable.

Put the curve in, and the feasible set shrinks to exactly the points the fleet can
actually reach. As a bonus, once the curve is an algebraic object inside the model, its
breakpoints can themselves become decision variables — which is how droop curves get
optimised rather than merely respected.

## The IEEE 1547 Volt-VAr law

The characteristic specified in IEEE Std 1547-2018 [[1]](#ref-1) is piecewise linear in
five segments, defined by six breakpoint voltages
``V^{\text{bp}}_1 \le \dots \le V^{\text{bp}}_6`` and the reactive set-point at each. Writing
``\bar q_i`` for the reactive capability of inverter ``i``:

```math
q_i(v_i) \;=\;
\begin{cases}
\bar q_i, & V^{\text{bp}}_1 \le v_i \le V^{\text{bp}}_2 \quad\text{(full injection)}\\[4pt]
\bar q_i \dfrac{V^{\text{bp}}_3 - v_i}{V^{\text{bp}}_3 - V^{\text{bp}}_2},
        & V^{\text{bp}}_2 \le v_i \le V^{\text{bp}}_3 \quad\text{(sloped)}\\[6pt]
0, & V^{\text{bp}}_3 \le v_i \le V^{\text{bp}}_4 \quad\text{(dead-band)}\\[4pt]
-\bar q_i \dfrac{v_i - V^{\text{bp}}_4}{V^{\text{bp}}_5 - V^{\text{bp}}_4},
        & V^{\text{bp}}_4 \le v_i \le V^{\text{bp}}_5 \quad\text{(sloped)}\\[6pt]
-\bar q_i, & V^{\text{bp}}_5 \le v_i \le V^{\text{bp}}_6 \quad\text{(full absorption)}
\end{cases} \tag{1}
```

Low voltage means inject reactive power to hold the voltage up; high voltage means
absorb it. Between the two sits a dead-band in which the inverter does nothing, so that
small fluctuations do not provoke needless reactive flow.

```@example tut
Vbp, qshape = collect(Float64, case.Vbp), collect(Float64, case.qshape)
plot(Vbp, qshape, lw = 3, color = :steelblue, label = "IEEE 1547 Q-V droop",
     xlabel = "terminal voltage  v  (p.u.)", ylabel = "q / q̄",
     title = "The Volt-VAr characteristic", ylims = (-1.35, 1.35), legend = :topright)
scatter!(Vbp, qshape, ms = 5, color = :steelblue, label = "breakpoints")
vspan!([Vbp[3], Vbp[4]], color = :grey, alpha = 0.12, label = "dead-band")
hline!([0], color = :black, lw = 0.6, alpha = 0.5, label = false)
annotate!([(Vbp[1] + 0.007, 1.13, text("inject", 8, :left, :steelblue)),
           (Vbp[6] - 0.007, -1.13, text("absorb", 8, :right, :steelblue))])
```

The curve used throughout this tutorial is the package default — breakpoints inside the
range the standard [[1]](#ref-1) permits the utility to set, and the values used in
[[6]](#ref-6):

## Why an "if-else" cannot go straight into a solver

The law above is a definition by cases, and that is exactly what a solver cannot read.
Two distinct obstacles follow.

**Conditional logic.** Which of the five expressions applies depends on ``v_i``, which is
itself a decision variable. Branching on the value of an unknown is not an algebraic
constraint, and an algebraic constraint is the only thing a solver accepts.

**Non-differentiability.** Even setting the branching aside, the slope jumps at every
breakpoint. Newton and interior-point methods build their steps from derivatives, and at
a kink the derivative does not exist.

There are two ways out, and they define the rest of this tutorial:

- **Introduce integer variables** to encode the logic exactly. The model becomes an
  MILP. This is the Big-M and Lambda / special-ordered-set-of-type-2 (SOS2) route.
- **Write the logic in closed algebraic form** using step functions. The model stays
  integer-free but becomes non-smooth, so it needs an NLP solver. This is the Heaviside
  route.

Before the details, here is the whole comparison on one screen. Each method answers a
different question, and that choice determines everything else about it:

**Table 2.** The three exact encodings of the droop at a glance.

| | **Big-M** | **Lambda / SOS2** | **Heaviside** |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| the question it asks | *which segment is active?* | *which two breakpoints am I between?* | none — the algebra selects |
| the device | one binary per segment, plus a large constant ``M`` | shared weights ``\lambda_b``, plus SOS2 adjacency | products of unit steps |
| extra variables, per inverter per time step | 5 binary + 2 continuous | 5 binary + 6 continuous | **none** |
| model class | MILP | MILP | NLP, non-smooth |
| anything to tune? | yes — the value of ``M`` | no | no |
| introduced in | [[5]](#ref-5) | [[6]](#ref-6), [[7]](#ref-7) | [[10]](#ref-10) |

The three columns are three answers to one question — how do you say "it depends" to a
solver — and each pays for exactness in a different currency: a constant you must choose,
a combinatorial structure, or differentiability.

## The host model

The droop is a self-contained module. Whatever distribution OPF you use, it exposes a
voltage magnitude at each inverter bus; the droop module adds the relationship tying
that inverter's reactive output to that voltage:

```
        ┌────────────────────────────┐
        │            DOPF            │
        │  network model + limits    │
        └───────┬────────────▲───────┘
         exposes│ vᵢ      qᵢᴳ│ sets
        ┌───────▼────────────┴───────┐
        │      Q-V droop module      │
        │   the IEEE 1547 curve      │
        └────────────────────────────┘
```

Nothing in the three encodings below depends on the host. They work equally with
LinDistFlow, a current-voltage alternating-current OPF (AC-OPF), an unbalanced three-phase
AC-OPF, or a full nonlinear AC-OPF — they only require that the host expose ``v_i`` at each
inverter bus.
That is a claim, so the [Three phases](@ref) section tests it: the same three encodings are
run against four hosts in all, two single-phase and two three-phase.

This package implements **two** hosts, selected with the `host` keyword, and the droop
block is identical in both:

**Table 3.** The two network models this package implements as hosts, selected with the `host` keyword.

| `host` | model | class | solve |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| `:ivacopf` (default) | **IVACOPF** — current-voltage AC-OPF [[4]](#ref-4), [[11]](#ref-11) | near-exact AC | successive linearisation, iterated |
| `:lindistflow` | **LinDistFlow** — linearised branch flow [[2]](#ref-2), [[3]](#ref-3) | linear approximation | one pass |

```julia
solve_dopf(case, Gurobi.Optimizer; method = :lambda)                       # IVACOPF
solve_dopf(case, Gurobi.Optimizer; method = :lambda, host = :lindistflow)  # LinDistFlow
```

**Every result on this page is generated with IVACOPF**, unless a comparison explicitly
says otherwise. Both models are set out below — briefly, because the subject here is the
droop, not the network model.

### IVACOPF — the host used here

The **current-voltage AC optimal power flow** (IVACOPF) of Soltani, Khorsand and Ma [[4]](#ref-4),
with the successive-linearisation scheme used here developed further in [[11]](#ref-11). The
network is written in rectangular current and voltage coordinates. Ohm's law and
Kirchhoff's current law (KCL) are then exactly linear. Two things remain bilinear — the ``v \cdot I`` power balance and the
``|I|^2`` branch loss — and these are handled by successive linearisation: each is
expanded about the previous iterate and the model is re-solved until the residual of the
*exact* loss identity falls below a tolerance. Convergence is checked against the true
nonlinear relation, not the linearised one, so the converged point satisfies the real
power flow.

#### IVACOPF in equations

Written out in full, so that the droop constraints later have somewhere concrete to
attach. Bus set ``\mathcal{B}``, branch set ``\mathcal{L}``, inverter buses
``\mathcal{G} \subset \mathcal{B}``, slack bus ``0``. Every quantity also carries a time
index ``t \in \{1,\dots,96\}``, suppressed throughout. A superscript ``\circ`` marks a
value **fixed from the previous iterate** — a constant, not a variable.

Voltage and current at bus ``i`` are split into real and imaginary parts,
``v_i^{\mathrm{re}}, v_i^{\mathrm{im}}`` and ``I_i^{\mathrm{re}}, I_i^{\mathrm{im}}``;
``I_{ij}`` is the current in branch ``(i,j)`` and ``v_i`` the voltage *magnitude*.

**Slack reference.**

```math
v_0^{\mathrm{re}} = V^{\mathrm{nom}}, \qquad v_0^{\mathrm{im}} = 0 \tag{2}
```

**Ohm's law along each branch** — exact and linear, which is the point of current-voltage
coordinates:

```math
\begin{aligned}
v_i^{\mathrm{re}} - v_j^{\mathrm{re}} &= R_{ij} I_{ij}^{\mathrm{re}} - X_{ij} I_{ij}^{\mathrm{im}}\\
v_i^{\mathrm{im}} - v_j^{\mathrm{im}} &= R_{ij} I_{ij}^{\mathrm{im}} + X_{ij} I_{ij}^{\mathrm{re}}
\end{aligned}
\qquad \forall (i,j) \in \mathcal{L} \tag{3}
```

**Current balance (KCL) at each bus** — also exact and linear:

```math
I_i^{\mathrm{re}} = \sum_{j:(i,j)\in\mathcal{L}} I_{ij}^{\mathrm{re}}
                  - \sum_{k:(k,i)\in\mathcal{L}} I_{ki}^{\mathrm{re}},
\qquad
I_i^{\mathrm{im}} = \sum_{j:(i,j)\in\mathcal{L}} I_{ij}^{\mathrm{im}}
                  - \sum_{k:(k,i)\in\mathcal{L}} I_{ki}^{\mathrm{im}} \tag{4}
```

**Power balance.** The true relation between injected power and current is bilinear:

```math
p_i = v_i^{\mathrm{re}} I_i^{\mathrm{re}} + v_i^{\mathrm{im}} I_i^{\mathrm{im}},
\qquad
q_i = v_i^{\mathrm{im}} I_i^{\mathrm{re}} - v_i^{\mathrm{re}} I_i^{\mathrm{im}} \tag{5}
```

Each product ``xy`` is replaced by its first-order expansion about the previous iterate,
``xy \approx x^{\circ}y + y^{\circ}x - x^{\circ}y^{\circ}``, giving the linear forms

```math
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{P}_i &:= v_i^{\mathrm{re}\circ} I_i^{\mathrm{re}} + I_i^{\mathrm{re}\circ} v_i^{\mathrm{re}}
              + v_i^{\mathrm{im}\circ} I_i^{\mathrm{im}} + I_i^{\mathrm{im}\circ} v_i^{\mathrm{im}}
              - v_i^{\mathrm{re}\circ} I_i^{\mathrm{re}\circ} - v_i^{\mathrm{im}\circ} I_i^{\mathrm{im}\circ}\\
\mathcal{Q}_i &:= v_i^{\mathrm{im}\circ} I_i^{\mathrm{re}} + I_i^{\mathrm{re}\circ} v_i^{\mathrm{im}}
              - v_i^{\mathrm{re}\circ} I_i^{\mathrm{im}} - I_i^{\mathrm{im}\circ} v_i^{\mathrm{re}}
              - v_i^{\mathrm{im}\circ} I_i^{\mathrm{re}\circ} + v_i^{\mathrm{re}\circ} I_i^{\mathrm{im}\circ}
\end{aligned} \tag{6}
```

which are then set equal to the net injection at each class of bus:

```math
\begin{aligned}
p_0^{\mathrm{grid}} &= \mathcal{P}_0, & q_0^{\mathrm{grid}} &= \mathcal{Q}_0 & &\text{slack}\\
-p_i^{L} &= \mathcal{P}_i, & -q_i^{L} &= \mathcal{Q}_i & &\forall i \in \mathcal{B}\setminus(\mathcal{G}\cup\{0\})\\
p_i^{G} - p_i^{L} &= \mathcal{P}_i, & q_i^{G} - q_i^{L} &= \mathcal{Q}_i & &\forall i \in \mathcal{G}
\end{aligned} \tag{7}
```

The last line is where the droop enters the network: ``q_i^{G}`` is exactly the variable
the three encodings below constrain.

**Branch losses**, from ``|I_{ij}|^2`` linearised the same way:

```math
P^{\mathrm{loss}}_{ij} = R_{ij}\Big(2 I_{ij}^{\mathrm{re}\circ} I_{ij}^{\mathrm{re}} - (I_{ij}^{\mathrm{re}\circ})^2
                              + 2 I_{ij}^{\mathrm{im}\circ} I_{ij}^{\mathrm{im}} - (I_{ij}^{\mathrm{im}\circ})^2\Big) \tag{8}
```

and ``Q^{\mathrm{loss}}_{ij}`` identically with ``X_{ij}`` in place of ``R_{ij}``.

**Voltage magnitude**, linearised about the previous iterate:

```math
v_i = \frac{v_i^{\mathrm{re}\circ}}{\sqrt{(v_i^{\mathrm{re}\circ})^2 + (v_i^{\mathrm{im}\circ})^2}}\, v_i^{\mathrm{re}}
    + \frac{v_i^{\mathrm{im}\circ}}{\sqrt{(v_i^{\mathrm{re}\circ})^2 + (v_i^{\mathrm{im}\circ})^2}}\, v_i^{\mathrm{im}} \tag{9}
```

This ``v_i`` is the single quantity the droop module reads.

**Voltage limits.**

```math
V^{\min} \le v_i \le V^{\max}, \qquad \forall i \in \mathcal{B} \tag{10}
```

**Convergence.** After each solve, the residual of the *exact* — not linearised — loss
identity is measured, and the loop repeats with a refreshed ``\circ`` point until

```math
\max_{(i,j),\,t}\;\Big|\,(v_i^{\mathrm{re}} - v_j^{\mathrm{re}})I_{ij}^{\mathrm{re}}
 + (v_i^{\mathrm{im}} - v_j^{\mathrm{im}})I_{ij}^{\mathrm{im}} - P^{\mathrm{loss}}_{ij}\Big| \;<\; \epsilon,
\qquad \epsilon = 10^{-6} \tag{11}
```

Checking against the true nonlinear relation is what makes the converged point a genuine
power-flow solution rather than a solution of the approximation.

In JuMP, with `_pr` marking a value carried over from the previous iterate:

                           - Ploss[(i,j),h,m]))
                   for (i,j) in BRANCH_SET, h in HOUR_SET, m in QUARTER_SET)
```

### LinDistFlow — the linear alternative

**LinDistFlow** [[3]](#ref-3), the linearised form of the branch-flow model [[2]](#ref-2), is what most of
the droop-integrated DOPF literature uses. It is the branch-flow model with the loss
terms dropped: for a radial feeder with small voltage deviations, keep the power balance
and the voltage drop, discard ``|I|^2``, and everything becomes linear.

```math
\begin{aligned}
p_j^{G} - p_j^{L} &= \sum_{k:(j,k)\in\mathcal{L}} P_{jk} \;-\; \sum_{i:(i,j)\in\mathcal{L}} P_{ij}\\
q_j^{G} - q_j^{L} &= \sum_{k:(j,k)\in\mathcal{L}} Q_{jk} \;-\; \sum_{i:(i,j)\in\mathcal{L}} Q_{ij}\\
v_j &= v_i + \Delta v_{ij}\\
\Delta v_{ij} &= -\,\frac{R_{ij}P_{ij} + X_{ij}Q_{ij}}{V^{\mathrm{nom}}}
\end{aligned} \tag{12}
```

Four equations, all linear, with the slack fixed at ``v_0 = V^{\mathrm{nom}}``. That is
the entire network model:

```julia
@constraint(model, [i in SLACK_SET, h in HOUR_SET, m in QUARTER_SET], v[i,h,m] == c.Vnom)

outflow(P, b, h, m) = sum(P[(i,j),h,m] for (i,j) in BRANCH_SET if i == b; init = 0.0)
inflow(P, b, h, m)  = sum(P[(i,j),h,m] for (i,j) in BRANCH_SET if j == b; init = 0.0)

# power balance — net injection = outflow − inflow, losses neglected
@constraint(model, [b in SLACK_SET, h in HOUR_SET, m in QUARTER_SET],
    Pgen[b,h,m] - c.Pload[b,h,m] == outflow(Pbr, b, h, m) - inflow(Pbr, b, h, m))
@constraint(model, [b in SLACK_SET, h in HOUR_SET, m in QUARTER_SET],
    Qgen[b,h,m] - c.Qload[b,h,m] == outflow(Qbr, b, h, m) - inflow(Qbr, b, h, m))
@constraint(model, [b in NON_DG_SET, h in HOUR_SET, m in QUARTER_SET],
    -c.Pload[b,h,m] == outflow(Pbr, b, h, m) - inflow(Pbr, b, h, m))
@constraint(model, [b in NON_DG_SET, h in HOUR_SET, m in QUARTER_SET],
    -c.Qload[b,h,m] == outflow(Qbr, b, h, m) - inflow(Qbr, b, h, m))
@constraint(model, [b in DG_SET, h in HOUR_SET, m in QUARTER_SET],
    Pdg[b,h,m] - c.Pload[b,h,m] == outflow(Pbr, b, h, m) - inflow(Pbr, b, h, m))
@constraint(model, [b in DG_SET, h in HOUR_SET, m in QUARTER_SET],
    Qdg[b,h,m] - c.Qload[b,h,m] == outflow(Qbr, b, h, m) - inflow(Qbr, b, h, m))

# voltage drop along each branch — v is a variable directly, no magnitude linearisation
@constraint(model, [(i,j) in BRANCH_SET, h in HOUR_SET, m in QUARTER_SET],
    v[j,h,m] == v[i,h,m] -
        (R[(i,j)] * Pbr[(i,j),h,m] + X[(i,j)] * Qbr[(i,j),h,m]) / c.Vnom)
```

**What changes for the droop: nothing.** ``v_i`` is a decision variable in both hosts, so
the droop block from any of the three methods drops in unchanged — which is the practical
meaning of the modularity claimed above, and the reason `host` is a keyword rather than a
different package.

**What changes for the solve:**

**Table 4.** What changes between the two single-phase hosts.

| | LinDistFlow | IVACOPF (used here) |
|:--|:--|:--|
| accuracy | approximate — losses dropped, radial feeder, small voltage deviations assumed | very accurate, near-exact AC |
| losses | not represented | modelled as ``\lvert I\rvert^2 R`` |
| solve | run **once** | **iterative** — re-linearised and re-solved until the residual clears ``\epsilon`` |
| effort | much faster, far lower computational cost | an MILP per pass, so several times the work |

The trade is accuracy against effort. LinDistFlow with Big-M or Lambda is a single MILP
with no outer loop — which is why it is the usual choice in this literature
[[6]](#ref-6), [[7]](#ref-7), and on the case study below it solves in well under a
second against roughly half a minute for IVACOPF. What you give up is accuracy. **Use IVACOPF for anything
quantitative**, which is also the choice made on accuracy grounds in [[11]](#ref-11).

### Using LinDistFlow to start IVACOPF

The two are not only alternatives — the cheap one makes the accurate one cheaper. By
default IVACOPF begins from a flat profile (``v = 1\angle 0``, all currents zero), which
is far from any solution. Passing `warm_start = :lindistflow` instead solves the linear
host first and expands its dispatch into a consistent complex state with an exact
power-flow sweep, so the first linearisation is taken about a point that is already close:

```julia
solve_dopf(case, Gurobi.Optimizer; method = :lambda, warm_start = :lindistflow)
```

**Table 5.** Warm-starting IVACOPF from LinDistFlow: fewer passes, same answer.

| start | passes | total solve | curtailed |
|:--|--:|--:|--:|
| flat (`:bigm` / `:lambda`) | 4 / 6 | 19.2 s / 16.1 s | 3022.0 kWh |
| `warm_start = :lindistflow` | 3 / 3 | 11.2 s / 9.2 s | 3022.0 kWh |

Half the passes for Lambda and roughly a 1.7× speed-up, warm-start solve included. The
curtailment is identical to the digit — which is the more interesting half of the result.
Two very different starting points converging on the same answer is evidence that the
answer belongs to the model rather than to the trajectory, and it is one of the checks
cited below.

## The setup

The IEEE 33-bus radial feeder, over a full day at 15-minute resolution — 96 time steps.
Three photovoltaic (PV) systems with smart inverters sit at buses 7, 18 and 33. Loads follow separate
industrial, commercial and residential shapes; PV follows a clear-sky irradiance profile.

**Table 6.** The three smart inverters of the single-phase case study: array rating, inverter rating and the resulting reactive capability ``\bar q``.

```@example tut
inverter_table()   # hide
```

Each inverter is rated 10 % above its PV array, so there is headroom for reactive support
even at full irradiance. Bus voltages are limited to
``[`` `` `` ``0.95, 1.05`` ``]`` p.u., and the objective is to **minimise total PV
curtailment** over the day.

```@example tut
avail = [collect(Float64, a) for a in case.avail_kW]
plot(hours, sum(avail), lw = 2, color = :darkorange, fillrange = 0, fillalpha = 0.18,
     label = "total PV available", xlabel = "hour of day", ylabel = "kW",
     title = "Available PV generation across the three inverters",
     xticks = 0:3:24, xlims = (0, 24), legend = :topleft)
for (i, b) in enumerate(case.DG_SET)
    plot!(hours, avail[i], lw = 1.4, ls = :dash, label = "bus $b")
end
plot!()
```

**Figure 2.** Available PV generation across the three inverters over the day, from a clear-sky irradiance profile at 15-minute resolution.

Why does a curtailment objective have anything to do with voltage at all? Because the
droop ties the two together. Active power injection raises the local voltage; the droop
reads that voltage and sets reactive power accordingly; and reactive flow moves voltages
across the whole feeder. The optimiser wants every kilowatt it can get — the droop
decides what taking it costs everywhere else.

### The inverter's own constraints

Three more constraint groups sit on ``(p_i^G, q_i^G)`` alongside the droop, and they
matter because they are what the droop has to coexist with.

**Apparent-power capability.** The inverter cannot exceed its rating,
``(p_i^{G})^2 + (q_i^{G})^2 \le (s_i^{G})^2``. That circle is convex but nonlinear, so
following [[6]](#ref-6) it is replaced by an inscribed ``2k``-sided polygon — exactly ``2k`` linear
constraints, tightening as ``k`` grows:

```math
-s_i^{G} \;\le\; \cos(\ell\phi)\, p_i^{G} + \sin(\ell\phi)\, q_i^{G} \;\le\; s_i^{G},
\qquad \phi = \frac{\pi}{k}, \quad \ell = 1,\dots,k, \quad \forall i \in \mathcal{G} \tag{13}
```

with ``k = 16`` here, giving a 32-vertex polygon. Because the inverter is oversized
relative to the array (``s_i^G = 1.1\,\bar p_i``), there is reactive headroom even at full
irradiance.

**Active and reactive bounds.** Active output is capped by the array rating and, at each
time step, by the available irradiance ``G(t)``; reactive output by the inverter rating:

```math
0 \;\le\; p_i^{G} \;\le\; p_i^{G,\max}(t) = \bar p_i\, G(t) \;\le\; \bar p_i,
\qquad
q_i^{G} \;\le\; \bar q_i \tag{14}
```

**Curtailment and the objective.** Curtailment is the shortfall against what was
available, and the objective is its total over all inverters and all time steps:

```math
\mathrm{PVC}_i(t) = p_i^{G,\max}(t) - p_i^{G}(t) \;\ge\; 0,
\qquad
\min \;\sum_{i \in \mathcal{G}} \sum_{t} \mathrm{PVC}_i(t) \tag{15}
```

This is objective ``OF_1`` of [[6]](#ref-6). Note what is *not* a decision here: ``q_i^G`` never
appears in the objective. It is pinned entirely by the droop, which is precisely the
point — the optimiser cannot buy voltage support by choosing reactive power freely, it
can only choose active power and live with the reactive response the curve produces.

All three groups in JuMP — identical under either host, because none of them touches the
network:

```julia
# apparent-power capability: a 2k-sided polygon inscribing the S-circle
k = 16
for l in 1:k
    θ = l * π / k
    @constraint(model, [d in DG_SET, h in HOUR_SET, m in QUARTER_SET],
        cos(θ) * Pdg[d,h,m] + sin(θ) * Qdg[d,h,m] <=  c.Sdg_max[d])
    @constraint(model, [d in DG_SET, h in HOUR_SET, m in QUARTER_SET],
        cos(θ) * Pdg[d,h,m] + sin(θ) * Qdg[d,h,m] >= -c.Sdg_max[d])
end

# active and reactive bounds
@constraint(model, [d in DG_SET, h in HOUR_SET, m in QUARTER_SET],
    Pdg[d,h,m] <= c.Pdg_max_vary[d][h,m])          # irradiance ceiling at this step
@constraint(model, [d in DG_SET, h in HOUR_SET, m in QUARTER_SET],
    Pdg[d,h,m] <= c.Pdg_max[d])                    # array rating
@constraint(model, [d in DG_SET, h in HOUR_SET, m in QUARTER_SET],
    Qdg[d,h,m] <= c.Sdg_max[d])

# curtailment and the objective
@constraint(model, [d in DG_SET, h in HOUR_SET, m in QUARTER_SET],
    PVC[d,h,m] == c.Pdg_max_vary[d][h,m] - Pdg[d,h,m])
@objective(model, Min, sum(PVC[d,h,m] for d in DG_SET, h in HOUR_SET, m in QUARTER_SET))
```

### The exact AC reference

Wherever this page compares a dispatch against "the exact AC solution", the reference is a
**backward/forward sweep** power flow [[13]](#ref-13) — no linearisation, iterated to a
fixed point for the given injections. It appears twice in the package:

**Table 7.** The exact AC reference used to audit a solved dispatch.

| function | what it does |
|:--|:--|
| [`base_case_voltages`](https://github.com/ra-emami/SmartInverterDOPF.jl/blob/main/src/dopf.jl) | the no-inverter reference case |
| [`SmartInverterDOPF._sweep_state`](https://github.com/ra-emami/SmartInverterDOPF.jl/blob/main/src/dopf.jl) | expands a dispatch into a full complex state — used both to warm-start IVACOPF and to audit a solved dispatch |

To run the audit yourself on any solved result:

```julia
using SmartInverterDOPF, Gurobi
case = load_case()
res  = solve_dopf(case, Gurobi.Optimizer; method = :lambda, host = :lindistflow)

v_r, v_im, _, _, _, _ = SmartInverterDOPF._sweep_state(case, res.Pdg, res.Qdg)
Vtrue = sqrt.(v_r .^ 2 .+ v_im .^ 2)               # the exact AC voltages

curve = ieee1547_curve()
maximum(abs.(res.V .- Vtrue))                      # how far the host's v is from the truth
maximum(abs(res.Qdg[i,h,m] - droop_q(curve, Vtrue[case.DG_SET[i],h,m],
                                     case.Sdg_max[case.DG_SET[i]]))
        for i in eachindex(case.DG_SET), h in 1:24, m in 1:4)   # droop residual at the true v
count(<(case.Vmin), Vtrue) + count(>(case.Vmax), Vtrue)         # real limit violations
```

### Running any host with any encoding

`method` and `host` are independent, so there are six single-phase combinations. Each has
a standalone script in
[`examples/single_phase/`](https://github.com/ra-emami/SmartInverterDOPF.jl/tree/main/examples/single_phase):

**Table 8.** The six single-phase example scripts, one per host and encoding.

## Method A — Big-M

*Following Savasci, Inaolaji and Paudyal [[5]](#ref-5), where this formulation was introduced for
a second-order-cone DOPF; also Chapter 4 of Inaolaji's dissertation [[9]](#ref-9).*

**The idea in one sentence.** Give every segment its own on/off switch, and write
constraints that are *switched off* — made trivially true — whenever their segment is
not the active one.

That switching-off is what "big-M" means. Take any constraint you want to enforce only
when a binary ``\delta`` equals 1, and add ``M(1-\delta)`` to its right-hand side. If
``\delta = 1`` the added term vanishes and the constraint bites. If ``\delta = 0`` the
right-hand side becomes so large that the constraint cannot possibly be violated — it is
still *present* in the model, but it no longer restricts anything. One constant, ``M``,
buys you an if-statement.

**Step 1: exactly one segment is active.** Introduce a binary ``\delta_b`` for each of
the five segments and require

```math
\sum_{b=1}^{5}\delta_{b}=1 . \tag{16}
```

**Step 2: each switch owns a voltage window.** If segment ``b`` is the active one, then
``v_i`` must lie in that segment's voltage range ``[V^{\text{bp}}_{b},
V^{\text{bp}}_{b+1}]``. In big-M form that is one two-sided inequality per segment, and
writing all five out gives the complete window system:

```math
\begin{aligned}
-(1-\delta_{1})M + V_i^{l}\;\; &\le v_i \le\;\; V^{\text{bp}}_{2} + (1-\delta_{1})M\\
-(1-\delta_{2})M + V^{\text{bp}}_{2} &\le v_i \le\;\; V^{\text{bp}}_{3} + (1-\delta_{2})M\\
-(1-\delta_{3})M + V^{\text{bp}}_{3} &\le v_i \le\;\; V^{\text{bp}}_{4} + (1-\delta_{3})M\\
-(1-\delta_{4})M + V^{\text{bp}}_{4} &\le v_i \le\;\; V^{\text{bp}}_{5} + (1-\delta_{4})M\\
-(1-\delta_{5})M + V^{\text{bp}}_{5} &\le v_i \le\;\; V_i^{u} + (1-\delta_{5})M
\end{aligned} \tag{17}
```

Each row is vacuous when its ``\delta_b = 0`` and binding when ``\delta_b = 1``, so
together with Step 1 the solver is forced to pick the segment that genuinely contains
``v_i``. Note the two outer rows: the first segment is bounded below by the variable's own
lower bound ``V_i^{l}`` and the last above by ``V_i^{u}``, rather than by
``V^{\text{bp}}_{1}`` and ``V^{\text{bp}}_{6}``. That keeps the model feasible if ``v_i``
ever sits outside the range the curve was drawn over — the saturated laws simply continue
to apply.

**Step 3: assemble the droop law — and watch it turn nonlinear.** With the switches in
place, ``q_i^G`` is just the sum of the five segment laws, each weighted by its own
binary. Segments 1, 3 and 5 contribute constants (``\bar q_i``, ``0``, ``-\bar q_i``);
the two sloped segments contribute their affine laws, written in slope–intercept form:

```math
q_i^G \;=\; \delta_1\,\bar q_i
\;+\; \delta_2\!\left(\alpha_1 v_i + \frac{\bar q_i V^{\text{bp}}_3}{V^{\text{bp}}_3 - V^{\text{bp}}_2}\right)
\;+\; \delta_3\cdot 0
\;+\; \delta_4\!\left(\alpha_2 v_i + \frac{\bar q_i V^{\text{bp}}_4}{V^{\text{bp}}_5 - V^{\text{bp}}_4}\right)
\;+\; \delta_5\left(-\bar q_i\right) \tag{18}
```

with slopes ``\alpha_1 = -\bar q_i/(V^{\text{bp}}_3-V^{\text{bp}}_2)`` and
``\alpha_2 = -\bar q_i/(V^{\text{bp}}_5-V^{\text{bp}}_4)``.

This is a correct statement of the curve: exactly one ``\delta_b`` equals 1, so exactly
one bracket survives and ``q_i^G`` takes that segment's value. But it is **not linear**.
Multiply the two sloped brackets out and the offending terms appear:

```math
\underbrace{\delta_2\,\alpha_1 v_i}_{\text{bilinear}} \qquad\text{and}\qquad
\underbrace{\delta_4\,\alpha_2 v_i}_{\text{bilinear}}
```

Each is a **product of two decision variables** — one binary, one continuous. Everything
else in the expression is a variable times a constant. So the whole difficulty of the
Big-M formulation reduces to these two products, and if they can be removed the model
becomes a plain MILP.

**Step 4: remove the two products, exactly.** The saving grace is that ``\delta_b`` is
binary rather than merely continuous, and ``v_i`` is bounded. Under those two conditions
each product can be replaced by a new continuous variable ``W_b := \delta_b v_i`` and
four linear inequalities, with **no approximation whatsoever**:

```math
-M(1-\delta_b) \;\le\; v_i - W_b \;\le\; M(1-\delta_b), \qquad
V^{\text{bp}}_{b}\,\delta_b \;\le\; W_b \;\le\; V^{\text{bp}}_{b+1}\,\delta_b . \tag{19}
```

Check the two cases and the exactness is immediate. If ``\delta_b = 1``, the left pair
forces ``W_b = v_i`` and the right pair confines ``v_i`` to the segment. If
``\delta_b = 0``, the right pair forces ``W_b = 0`` (both bounds collapse to zero) while
the left pair goes slack. Either way ``W_b`` equals ``\delta_b v_i`` exactly — this is a
reformulation, not a relaxation.

Only segments 2 and 4 need this treatment, and for those the ``W_b`` bounds already pin
``v_i`` into the segment, so their Step-2 window rows are replaced rather than added to.
The complete constraint system for the Big-M droop is therefore:

```math
\begin{aligned}
-(1-\delta_{1})M + V_i^{l}\;\; &\le v_i \le\; V^{\text{bp}}_{2} + (1-\delta_{1})M\\[2pt]
-M(1-\delta_{2}) \;&\le\; v_i - W_{2} \;\le\; (1-\delta_{2})M\\
V^{\text{bp}}_{2}\,\delta_{2} \;&\le\; W_{2} \;\le\; V^{\text{bp}}_{3}\,\delta_{2}\\[2pt]
-(1-\delta_{3})M + V^{\text{bp}}_{3} &\le v_i \le\; V^{\text{bp}}_{4} + (1-\delta_{3})M\\[2pt]
-M(1-\delta_{4}) \;&\le\; v_i - W_{4} \;\le\; (1-\delta_{4})M\\
V^{\text{bp}}_{4}\,\delta_{4} \;&\le\; W_{4} \;\le\; V^{\text{bp}}_{5}\,\delta_{4}\\[2pt]
-(1-\delta_{5})M + V^{\text{bp}}_{5} &\le v_i \le\; V_i^{u} + (1-\delta_{5})M
\end{aligned} \tag{20}
```

Read alongside the Step-2 system, the change is visible: rows 2 and 4 — the sloped
segments — have each become a ``W`` definition plus a ``W`` range, while the three flat
segments keep their original windows unchanged.

Now substitute ``\delta_2 v_i \to W_2`` and ``\delta_4 v_i \to W_4`` in the Step 3
expression. Nothing else changes, and the droop law becomes a single **linear** equation
in which every coefficient is a constant:

```math
q_i^G = \delta_1\bar q_i
      + \alpha_1 W_2 + \delta_2\frac{\bar q_i V^{\text{bp}}_3}{V^{\text{bp}}_3 - V^{\text{bp}}_2}
      + \alpha_2 W_4 + \delta_4\frac{\bar q_i V^{\text{bp}}_4}{V^{\text{bp}}_5 - V^{\text{bp}}_4}
      - \delta_5\bar q_i \tag{21}
```

Compare it with the Step 3 version: the two bracketed sloped terms have simply been split
into a ``W`` term and a ``\delta`` term. That substitution is the entire content of the
Big-M droop model.

In JuMP:

```julia
@variable(model, δ[1:5, DG_SET, HOUR_SET, QUARTER_SET], Bin)
@variable(model, W2[DG_SET, HOUR_SET, QUARTER_SET])
@variable(model, W4[DG_SET, HOUR_SET, QUARTER_SET])

@constraint(model, [d in DG_SET, h in HOUR_SET, m in QUARTER_SET],
    sum(δ[i, d, h, m] for i in 1:5) == 1)

# flat segments 1, 3, 5 — the binary only switches on a voltage window
for (i, lo, hi) in ((1, 1, 2), (3, 3, 4), (5, 5, 6))
    @constraint(model, [d in DG_SET, h in HOUR_SET, m in QUARTER_SET],
        v[d, h, m] >= Vbp[lo] - Mbig * (1 - δ[i, d, h, m]))
    @constraint(model, [d in DG_SET, h in HOUR_SET, m in QUARTER_SET],
        v[d, h, m] <= Vbp[hi] + Mbig * (1 - δ[i, d, h, m]))
end

# sloped segments 2 and 4 — W = δ·v, whose bounds double as the window
for (i, W, lo, hi) in ((2, W2, 2, 3), (4, W4, 4, 5))
    @constraint(model, [d in DG_SET, h in HOUR_SET, m in QUARTER_SET],
        v[d, h, m] - W[d, h, m] >= -Mbig * (1 - δ[i, d, h, m]))
    @constraint(model, [d in DG_SET, h in HOUR_SET, m in QUARTER_SET],
        v[d, h, m] - W[d, h, m] <=  Mbig * (1 - δ[i, d, h, m]))
    @constraint(model, [d in DG_SET, h in HOUR_SET, m in QUARTER_SET],
        W[d, h, m] >= Vbp[lo] * δ[i, d, h, m])
    @constraint(model, [d in DG_SET, h in HOUR_SET, m in QUARTER_SET],
        W[d, h, m] <= Vbp[hi] * δ[i, d, h, m])
end
```

!!! tip "Choose M as tightly as you can justify"
    ``M`` only has to dominate the largest possible violation of a deactivated
    constraint, which here is set by the voltage bounds. A needlessly large ``M`` leaves
    the LP relaxation loose, the branch-and-bound tree deep, and the solve slow. The
    value used here is `1.1`.

The cost of exactness is bookkeeping: five binaries per inverter per time step, plus two
auxiliary continuous variables.

## Method B — Lambda / SOS2

*Following Inaolaji, Savasci and Paudyal [[6]](#ref-6) and its three-phase extension [[7]](#ref-7), which
apply the classical lambda method to Volt-VAr and Volt-Watt droops on a LinDistFlow
host; see also Chapter 5 of [[9]](#ref-9).*

**The idea in one sentence.** Instead of asking *which segment am I on*, describe the
operating point directly as a blend of two neighbouring breakpoints.

Big-M starts from the case distinction and works to make it linear. Lambda never forms
the case distinction at all. It uses a fact about piecewise-linear curves: **every point
on the curve is a weighted average of two adjacent breakpoints**, and nothing else is.

So attach a weight ``\lambda_b \ge 0`` to each of the six breakpoints, make the weights
sum to one, and build *both* coordinates from the same weights:

```math
v_i = \sum_{b=1}^{6}\lambda_b V^{\text{bp}}_b, \qquad
q_i^G = \sum_{b=1}^{6}\lambda_b q^{\text{bp}}_b, \qquad
\sum_{b=1}^{6}\lambda_b = 1, \qquad \lambda_b \ge 0 . \tag{22}
```

The single shared ``\lambda`` is the whole trick. Because one set of weights generates
the voltage *and* the reactive power, the pair ``(v_i, q_i^G)`` cannot drift off the
curve — move the weights and both coordinates slide together along it. Both
``V^{\text{bp}}_b`` and ``q^{\text{bp}}_b`` are constants, so these are ordinary linear
constraints, and no ``M`` needs choosing anywhere.

**The catch.** As written, the weights describe the *convex hull* of the six
breakpoints, not the curve. Nothing yet stops the solver putting weight on ``\lambda_1``
and ``\lambda_5`` simultaneously, which lands the operating point somewhere in the
interior of that hull — a ``(v, q)`` pair the inverter would never produce. Since
interior points give the optimiser more reactive power at a given voltage than the real
device offers, it will happily take them.

**The fix** is the classical **SOS2** condition: at most two weights may be nonzero, and
they must be *adjacent*. That is exactly the "blend of two neighbouring breakpoints"
statement, imposed rather than hoped for. Introduce one binary ``z_b`` per segment —
five of them for six breakpoints — and write, in full:

```math
\begin{aligned}
\lambda_1 &\le z_1\\
\lambda_2 &\le z_1 + z_2\\
\lambda_3 &\le z_2 + z_3\\
\lambda_4 &\le z_3 + z_4\\
\lambda_5 &\le z_4 + z_5\\
\lambda_6 &\le z_5\\[2pt]
\sum_{b=1}^{5} z_b &= 1, \qquad z_b \in \{0,1\}
\end{aligned} \tag{23}
```

Read it as: ``z_b = 1`` names the active segment; a weight ``\lambda_b`` is allowed to be
nonzero only if breakpoint ``b`` is an endpoint of that segment. Since exactly one
``z_b`` is 1, precisely two adjacent weights survive and every other weight is forced to
zero. The blend is back on the curve.

Trace one case to see it work. Suppose ``z_3 = 1`` and every other ``z_b = 0``. Rows 1, 2
and 6 then force ``\lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = \lambda_6 = 0``; row 5 forces
``\lambda_5 = 0``; and only ``\lambda_3 \le 1`` and ``\lambda_4 \le 1`` survive. With
``\sum_b \lambda_b = 1`` the operating point is a blend of breakpoints 3 and 4 alone —
that is, a point on segment 3, the dead-band.

Collecting everything, the complete Lambda droop model is:

```math
\begin{aligned}
v_i &= \sum_{b=1}^{6}\lambda_b V^{\text{bp}}_b\\
q_i^G &= \sum_{b=1}^{6}\lambda_b q^{\text{bp}}_b\\
\sum_{b=1}^{6}\lambda_b &= 1, \qquad \lambda_b \ge 0\\
\lambda_1 \le z_1, \quad \lambda_b &\le z_{b-1} + z_b \;\;(b=2,\dots,5), \quad \lambda_6 \le z_5\\
\sum_{b=1}^{5} z_b &= 1, \qquad z_b \in \{0,1\}
\end{aligned} \tag{24}
```

Seven constraint rows and no constant to tune — compare that with the Big-M system above.

Worth noticing what is *absent*: no big-M constant, and no product of a binary with a
continuous variable. The binaries here only switch other variables off — a much
better-behaved use of integrality, and the reason this formulation tends to give tighter
relaxations than Big-M on the same curve.

```julia
@variable(model, λ[1:6, DG_SET, HOUR_SET, QUARTER_SET] >= 0)
@variable(model, z[1:5, DG_SET, HOUR_SET, QUARTER_SET], Bin)

@constraint(model, [d in DG_SET, h in HOUR_SET, m in QUARTER_SET],
    sum(λ[i, d, h, m] for i in 1:6) == 1)
@constraint(model, [d in DG_SET, h in HOUR_SET, m in QUARTER_SET],
    sum(z[i, d, h, m] for i in 1:5) == 1)
@constraint(model, [d in DG_SET, h in HOUR_SET, m in QUARTER_SET],
    λ[1, d, h, m] <= z[1, d, h, m])
@constraint(model, [i in 2:5, d in DG_SET, h in HOUR_SET, m in QUARTER_SET],
    λ[i, d, h, m] <= z[i-1, d, h, m] + z[i, d, h, m])
@constraint(model, [d in DG_SET, h in HOUR_SET, m in QUARTER_SET],
    λ[6, d, h, m] <= z[5, d, h, m])

@constraint(model, [d in DG_SET, h in HOUR_SET, m in QUARTER_SET],
    v[d, h, m] == sum(λ[i, d, h, m] * Vbp[i] for i in 1:6))
@constraint(model, [d in DG_SET, h in HOUR_SET, m in QUARTER_SET],
    Qdg[d, h, m] == sum(λ[i, d, h, m] * qpts[d][i] for i in 1:6))
```

!!! note "SOS2 without the binaries"
    Most MILP solvers support SOS2 natively via `MOI.SOS2`, which lets the solver
    branch on the set directly instead of on explicit binaries. The formulation above is
    written out longhand because it is portable and because it makes the logic visible —
    which is the point of a tutorial.

The Lambda form has a decisive practical advantage over Big-M once you stop treating the
curve as fixed. The breakpoint voltages ``V^{\text{bp}}_b`` appear *linearly* here, and in
only one place. Make them decision variables — so the OPF chooses the curve as well as
the dispatch — and exactly one product turns bilinear:

```math
v_i = \sum_{b=1}^{6}\lambda_b V^{\text{bp}}_b \tag{25}
```

A single, well-understood bilinear term, routinely handled by a McCormick envelope and
tightened by partitioning the breakpoint range if the relaxation is too loose. The
reactive equation ``q_i^G = \sum_b \lambda_b q^{\text{bp}}_b`` is untouched, since the
ordinates stay constant.

Big-M remains exact under the same change — nothing about it stops representing the
curve — but the nonlinearity it acquires is both more widespread and of a worse kind. The
slopes ``\alpha_1 = -\bar q_i/(V^{\text{bp}}_3 - V^{\text{bp}}_2)`` and ``\alpha_2`` become
*rational functions* of the breakpoints, so in the droop law the terms
``\alpha_1 W_2 + \delta_2\,\bar q_i V^{\text{bp}}_3/(V^{\text{bp}}_3 - V^{\text{bp}}_2)`` and
their segment-4 counterparts are nonlinear in ``V^{\text{bp}}`` rather than merely
bilinear; and the segment bounds
``V^{\text{bp}}_b \delta_b \le W_b \le V^{\text{bp}}_{b+1}\delta_b`` pick up further
products of breakpoints with binaries. Lambda confines the whole difficulty to one term;
Big-M spreads it across the droop law *and* the bounds. That is why work on optimised and
adaptive droop curves is normally built on Lambda [[8]](#ref-8), [[11]](#ref-11).

## Method C — Heaviside

*Following Inaolaji, Savasci and Paudyal [[10]](#ref-10), which introduced this encoding precisely
to remove the integer variables from the two formulations above, on the same
current–voltage DOPF host used here; see also Chapter 6 of [[9]](#ref-9).*

**The idea in one sentence.** Keep the case distinction, but write it as arithmetic
instead of logic — so there is nothing for a solver to branch on.

Both previous methods spend integer variables to answer "which segment?". Integers are
what make a model combinatorial: the count grows with inverters × time steps, and
branch-and-bound has to search over them. The motivation in [[10]](#ref-10) is to get rid of them
altogether, which also makes the model a candidate for real-time use.

The observation is that an "if" is just an on/off switch, and the unit step *is* an
on/off switch written as a function:

```math
H(x) = \begin{cases} 1, & x \ge 0\\ 0, & x < 0\end{cases} \tag{26}
```

Shift it to flip at a breakpoint and subtract two of them, and you get a **window** that
equals 1 on one segment and 0 everywhere else:

```math
\mathcal{W}_b(v_i) \;=\; H\!\left(v_i - V^{\text{bp}}_{b}\right) - H\!\left(v_i - V^{\text{bp}}_{b+1}\right) \tag{27}
```

which is precisely the condition ``V^{\text{bp}}_b \le v_i \le V^{\text{bp}}_{b+1}`` — the
if-else of segment ``b``, written without logic and without binaries. Multiply each
segment's law by its own window and add them up. The windows are disjoint, so at any
voltage all but one vanish and the sum collapses to the single active law.

Written out with every window expanded, and with all five segments present so the
structure is visible:

```math
\begin{aligned}
q_i^G \;=\; &\;\;\;\;\bar q_i \big[\,H(v_i - V^{\text{bp}}_1) - H(v_i - V^{\text{bp}}_2)\,\big] \;+\\
&\;\alpha_1\!\left(v_i - V^{\text{bp}}_3\right)\big[\,H(v_i - V^{\text{bp}}_2) - H(v_i - V^{\text{bp}}_3)\,\big] \;+\\
&\;\;\;\;0\,\big[\,H(v_i - V^{\text{bp}}_3) - H(v_i - V^{\text{bp}}_4)\,\big] \;+\\
&\;\alpha_2\!\left(v_i - V^{\text{bp}}_4\right)\big[\,H(v_i - V^{\text{bp}}_4) - H(v_i - V^{\text{bp}}_5)\,\big] \;-\\
&\;\;\;\;\bar q_i \big[\,H(v_i - V^{\text{bp}}_5) - H(v_i - V^{\text{bp}}_6)\,\big]
\end{aligned} \tag{28}
```

with the same slopes as before,
``\alpha_1 = -\bar q_i/(V^{\text{bp}}_3-V^{\text{bp}}_2)`` and
``\alpha_2 = -\bar q_i/(V^{\text{bp}}_5-V^{\text{bp}}_4)``.

That is the entire droop model — one equation, no auxiliary variables, no constraint
system to accompany it. Line 3 is written out only for symmetry; being identically zero,
it is dropped in the implementation.


!!! tip "Anchor each sloped term at its zero crossing"
    This is the one place where it is easy to get the algebra wrong, so it is worth
    stating explicitly. A sloped term is written ``\alpha(v_i - V^{\ast})`` where
    ``V^{\ast}`` is the voltage at which *that segment's* reactive output passes through
    zero — ``V^{\text{bp}}_3`` for segment 2, and ``V^{\text{bp}}_4`` for segment 4.

    Anchoring anywhere else breaks the curve. Anchor segment 2 at ``V^{\text{bp}}_2``
    instead, for example, and the term evaluates to ``0`` at ``V^{\text{bp}}_2`` where the
    curve should read ``\bar q_i``, leaving a jump at the breakpoint. With the anchors
    above, segment 2 gives ``\bar q_i`` at ``V^{\text{bp}}_2`` and ``0`` at
    ``V^{\text{bp}}_3``, matching the flat segments it joins on either side. The
    verification section below is what confirms this came out right.

```julia
Hstep(x) = op_ifelse(op_greater_than_or_equal_to(x, 0), 1.0, 0.0)
α1 = Dict(d => -qbar[d] / (Vbp[3] - Vbp[2]) for d in DG_SET)
α2 = Dict(d => -qbar[d] / (Vbp[5] - Vbp[4]) for d in DG_SET)

@constraint(model, [d in DG_SET, h in HOUR_SET, m in QUARTER_SET],
    Qdg[d, h, m] ==
        qbar[d] * (Hstep(v[d,h,m] - Vbp[1]) - Hstep(v[d,h,m] - Vbp[2]))
      + α1[d] * (v[d,h,m] - Vbp[3]) * (Hstep(v[d,h,m] - Vbp[2]) - Hstep(v[d,h,m] - Vbp[3]))
      + α2[d] * (v[d,h,m] - Vbp[4]) * (Hstep(v[d,h,m] - Vbp[4]) - Hstep(v[d,h,m] - Vbp[5]))
      - qbar[d] * (Hstep(v[d,h,m] - Vbp[5]) - Hstep(v[d,h,m] - Vbp[6])))
```

`op_ifelse` and `op_greater_than_or_equal_to` are JuMP's nonlinear operators
(JuMP ≥ 1.15); they build the expression correctly outside a macro.

No extra variables at all — one algebraic expression per inverter per time step. The
price is paid in solver behaviour, and it is not merely theoretical. ``H(\cdot)`` is
discontinuous, so the derivative is undefined at every breakpoint and the problem is
non-convex. On this case study Ipopt does reach the same answer as the MILP encodings,
but the first pass — started from a flat voltage profile, far from the solution — stops
at `ALMOST_LOCALLY_SOLVED`, short of its own convergence tolerance:

**Table 9.** Successive-linearisation passes for the Heaviside encoding on the IVACOPF host, single-phase case study.

```@example tut
iteration_table("heaviside")   # hide
```

Once the linearisation point is close enough that most inverters sit comfortably inside a
single segment, the later passes converge cleanly. But that first pass is the
non-smoothness showing up in practice: an interior-point method cannot get reliable
derivative information at the kinks, and a harder case — more inverters, voltages sitting
nearer the breakpoints — is where this bites. In production this encoding is normally
*smoothed*, the step replaced by a sigmoid ``H(x) \approx (1 + e^{-kx})^{-1}``, which
restores differentiability at the cost of no longer representing the curve exactly.

## Verification: does the dispatch actually lie on the curve?

This is the check that matters. Each method is exact only if every one of the
``3 \times 96 = 288`` optimised operating points lands on the droop.

The curves below are drawn in **absolute p.u. VArs** rather than normalised by ``\bar
q_i``. Normalising would collapse all three inverters onto one line and hide the thing
worth seeing: each inverter has its own reactive capability, so each follows its own
curve, and a dispatch point is only correct if it lies on the curve *of its own
inverter*. The shaded band is the admissible voltage range ``[0.95, 1.05]``.

```@example tut
si_color = [:seagreen, :orangered, :dodgerblue]        # in DG_SET order: 7, 18, 33
dgs      = collect(Int, case.DG_SET)

**Figure 3.** Every optimised operating point, plotted against the droop curve it must satisfy. All 3 x 96 points lie on the curve.

```@example tut
droop_figure("lambda")
```

**Figure 4.** The same verification for the Lambda / SOS2 encoding.

```@example tut
droop_figure("heaviside")
```

**Figure 5.** The same verification for the Heaviside encoding, which carries no integer variables.

Every point sits on the curve of its own inverter, and the three reactive capabilities —
``\bar q = 0.242``, ``0.110`` and ``0.165`` p.u., that is 2420, 1100 and 1650 kVAr — are
now visible as the three separated flat tails. Numerically:

**Table 10.** Exactness of each encoding: the largest gap between the dispatched reactive power and the curve evaluated at the dispatched voltage, over all inverters and time steps.

```@example tut
deviation_table()   # hide
```

All three are at the level of floating-point round-off, which is what "exact" means here:
the encodings do not approximate the curve, they reproduce it.

Note that the operating points cluster in the sloped region below nominal and in the
dead-band. The saturated tails are never reached — on this feeder the voltage never drops
to ``V^{\text{bp}}_2`` nor rises to ``V^{\text{bp}}_5``. The flat segments still have to be
in the model, because the solver must be free to consider them, but they do no work here.

## Side by side

**Table 11.** The three encodings side by side on the single-phase case study, IVACOPF host.

```@example tut
comparison_table()   # hide
```

The three rows agree on every physical quantity. Curtailed energy matches to four
significant figures, losses to five, and the voltage range is identical to four
decimals.
The residual differences are the NLP solver's convergence tolerance, not a modelling
difference — which is the empirical statement of the claim that these are three
encodings of one curve.

What differs is the machinery. Heaviside adds no variables at all; Big-M and Lambda each
add 1440 binaries — five per inverter per time step — and that count grows with
inverters × time steps, which is the scaling wall for the integer methods. Big-M reached
its answer in fewer successive-linearisation passes here, but iteration counts of this
kind are case-specific and should not be read as a general ranking.

Heaviside's fewer passes do not translate into less total time, because a pass is not
the same amount of work in the two solver worlds. Each Heaviside iteration asks Ipopt to
run its interior-point method to convergence on the nonlinear system — roughly
14 s per pass here — while each Big-M or Lambda iteration asks Gurobi to resolve a model
that is still mostly linear, with only 1440 binaries riding on top of it — 4-6 s per pass.
That per-iteration cost, not the pass count, is what makes Heaviside the slowest of the
three despite needing the fewest of them.

!!! warning "Solve times are indicative only"
    These timings come from a single run on one machine with one solver configuration,
    and the successive-linearisation loop rebuilds the model from scratch each pass. Read
    them as orders of magnitude, not as a ranking of the encodings: the few seconds
    between Big-M and Lambda here are well inside run-to-run variation, and reversing on
    another machine would surprise nobody.

### The two hosts disagree — and the exact power flow says which to believe

Running the same case on both hosts turns this from a puzzle into a measurement. Same
feeder, same droop, same inverters, same objective; only the network model differs:

**Table 12.** The two single-phase hosts disagree by a factor of fifty on curtailed energy.

| host | curtailed | at its own worst-curtailed step |
|:--|--:|:--|
| IVACOPF | 3022 kWh | ``q^G = 0``, ``\lvert S\rvert/S_{\max} = 0.38``, no bus at a voltage limit |
| LinDistFlow | 60.5 kWh | ``\lvert S\rvert/S_{\max} = 1.001`` — the inverter is at its rating |

A factor of fifty. The tempting reading is that IVACOPF curtails for no reason. The test
that settles it is to stop asking either model about itself: take each dispatch, solve the
**exact** AC power flow for those injections with a backward/forward sweep, and check the
result against the physics both models claim to represent.

**Table 13.** The exact-power-flow audit of the single-phase case, which settles the disagreement of Table 12.

| dispatch | its own ``v`` vs the true AC ``v`` | droop residual at the **true** voltage | steps outside ``[0.95, 1.05]`` |
|:--|--:|--:|--:|
| LinDistFlow | off by ``7.8\times10^{-3}`` p.u. | ``6.1\times10^{-2}`` p.u. | **17** |
| IVACOPF | ``9.6\times10^{-9}`` | ``7.9\times10^{-8}`` | 0 |

That is decisive, and it runs the other way from the tempting reading. **LinDistFlow's
60.5 kWh is not achievable.** Put its own dispatch on the real network and the inverters
sit off their droop curves by 6 % of rating — they would not produce that reactive power
at those voltages — and seventeen quarter-hours fall below the lower voltage limit. It
buys its low curtailment by neglecting losses and by taking the voltage drop as
``-(RP + XQ)/V^{\mathrm{nom}}``, and the dispatch it returns cannot be delivered.

The IVACOPF dispatch reproduces the exact AC solution to nine decimal places, sits on the
droop to ``8\times10^{-8}``, and violates nothing. Its 3022 kWh is the physical answer.

A further check supports it. Starting the linearisation from the LinDistFlow solution
rather than a flat profile converges to the *identical* 3022.0 kWh from a completely
different starting point, so the answer is a property of the model's physics rather than
of the path taken to it.

!!! note "Which host to use"
    Use `:ivacopf` for anything quantitative: it is the accurate model, and it is the one
    selected on accuracy grounds in [[11]](#ref-11). `:lindistflow` earns its place as a
    fast convex first look and as a starting point for IVACOPF (below), but its dispatch
    should not be reported as a result.

What remains genuinely open is why the binding mechanism is so indirect — at the
worst-curtailed step nothing sits at a limit, yet the exact power flow confirms that more
injection is not deliverable under the droop. Worth understanding before building
curtailment studies on any host.

## Impact of Volt–Var Droop Control on Feeder Voltage Regulation

The comparison so far has been between encodings. The more useful comparison is against
not having the inverters at all. The base case is the same feeder and the same demand
with no smart inverters, solved by a backward/forward sweep power flow.

```@example tut
buses = 1:case.n_bus
p = plot(xlabel = "bus", ylabel = "voltage (p.u.)", legend = :topright,
         title = "Daily voltage envelope, with and without smart inverters",
         xticks = [1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 33], xlims = (1, 33))
plot!(p, buses, collect(Float64, case.V_base_max), lw = 2, ls = :dash,
      color = :grey65, label = "no inverters — max")
plot!(p, buses, collect(Float64, case.V_base_min), lw = 2, ls = :dash,
      color = :grey35, label = "no inverters — min")
plot!(p, buses, collect(Float64, runs["lambda"].V_with_max), lw = 2.2,
      color = :darkorange2, label = "with inverters — max")
plot!(p, buses, collect(Float64, runs["lambda"].V_with_min), lw = 2.2,
      color = :dodgerblue4, label = "with inverters — min")
hline!(p, [case.Vmin_limit, case.Vmax_limit], ls = :dot, lw = 1.5, color = :red,
       label = "limits")
```

**Figure 6.** Daily voltage envelope along the feeder, with and without the smart inverters. The droop lifts the low end of the envelope off the lower limit.

Without the inverters the feeder violates its lower voltage limit: the minimum across the
day reaches

```@example tut
base_case_sentence()   # hide
```

With the droop-controlled inverters the whole envelope sits inside the band: the
worst-case voltage rises to 0.9501 p.u. and the feeder complies.

The reactive support is not a marginal improvement here — it is what makes the feeder
operable at all. Rerun the same case with the curve flattened to ``q \equiv 0``, so the
inverters still deliver active power but provide no reactive support, and the OPF is
**infeasible** at these voltage limits. There is no active-power dispatch that keeps this
feeder inside ``[0.95, 1.05]`` without Volt-VAr control.

Following a single inverter through the day shows the mechanism:

```@example tut
r  = runs["lambda"]
i  = 2                                  # the inverter at bus 18, at the end of the feeder
b  = case.DG_SET[i]
V  = collect(Float64, r.Vdg_series[i])
Q  = collect(Float64, r.Qdg_series[i])
P  = collect(Float64, r.Pdg_series[i])
A  = collect(Float64, case.avail_kW[i])

p1 = plot(hours, V, lw = 2, color = :dodgerblue4, label = "v at bus $b",
          ylabel = "voltage (p.u.)", xticks = 0:3:24, xlims = (0, 24), legend = :topleft)
hline!(p1, [case.Vmin_limit], ls = :dot, color = :red, label = "lower limit")
hline!(p1, [Vbp[3], Vbp[4]], ls = :dash, color = :grey55, alpha = 0.8,
       label = "dead-band edges")

p2 = plot(hours, Q, lw = 2, color = :seagreen, label = "reactive output",
          ylabel = "kVAr", xticks = 0:3:24, xlims = (0, 24), legend = :bottomright)
hline!(p2, [0], color = :black, lw = 0.6, alpha = 0.5, label = false)

p3 = plot(hours, A, lw = 2, ls = :dash, color = :grey45, label = "available",
          xlabel = "hour of day", ylabel = "kW", xticks = 0:3:24, xlims = (0, 24),
          legend = :topleft)
plot!(p3, hours, P, lw = 2, color = :darkorange2, fillrange = 0, fillalpha = 0.15,
      label = "delivered")

plot(p1, p2, p3, layout = (3, 1), size = (780, 700), link = :x,
     left_margin = 5Plots.mm)
```

**Figure 7.** One inverter over the day: terminal voltage, reactive output and active output, showing the droop responding to the voltage it senses.

Bus 18 sits at the far end of the main feeder, so it swings furthest and exercises the
whole curve in a single day. Read the top two panels together and the droop law is simply
visible:

- **Overnight and early morning**, voltage sits near 0.958 p.u., below the dead-band. The
  inverter is on the upper sloped segment and **injects** about 200 kVAr to hold the
  voltage up.
- **Around 08:45**, PV output pushes the voltage up through ``V^{\text{bp}}_3 = 0.97``.
  The inverter enters the dead-band and reactive output goes to **exactly zero** — the
  flat stretch in the middle panel, lasting until roughly 09:45.
- **Mid-morning onward**, voltage crosses ``V^{\text{bp}}_4 = 1.00`` and climbs to about
  1.006 p.u. by midday. Now on the lower sloped segment, the inverter **absorbs** up to
  320 kVAr to push back against the PV-driven voltage rise.
- **Late afternoon**, the sequence reverses, back through the dead-band and into
  injection for the evening.

Every one of those transitions happens at a breakpoint of the curve, with no set-point
sent from anywhere: the inverter is reading its own terminal voltage, and the OPF has
scheduled the feeder knowing exactly what it will do. The bottom panel shows this inverter
delivering all the active power available to it — the reactive support is enough here, so
nothing is curtailed at bus 18.

## Three phases

Everything so far has been single-phase. Real low-voltage feeders are not: loads connect
between one phase and neutral, so the phases carry different currents and sit at different
voltages, and an inverter on phase 1 sees a different terminal voltage from its neighbour
on phase 2.

The question this section answers is not whether a three-phase network model can be
built — it can — but **what changes in the droop encodings when it is**. The short answer
is nothing, and the rest of this section is about why that is worth knowing.

To make that answer testable rather than merely plausible, the section carries **two**
three-phase hosts — a linear one and a near-exact one — and runs all three encodings on
both. Six runs, one curve, and a clean split between what the encoding is responsible for
and what the network model is.

### Two three-phase hosts

The droop needs a host, and this section provides two — deliberately, because the pair
makes the separation between *encoding* and *host* measurable rather than merely asserted:

**Table 14.** The two three-phase hosts, and the script family implementing each.

| script family | model | class | solve |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| `LinDist3Flow_*.jl` | **LinDist3Flow** — multiphase linearised branch flow [[12]](#ref-12) | linear approximation | one pass |
| `IVACOPF3Ph_*.jl` | **IVACOPF** — three-phase current-voltage AC-OPF [[4]](#ref-4) | near-exact AC | successive linearisation, iterated |

Both are set out in full below — briefly, because the subject of this page is the droop,
not the network model — and both carry the same three droop blocks, the same feeder, the
same fleet and the same objective. Everything that is *shared* between them, the inverter
model, is stated once:

```math
\begin{aligned}
p_i^{G} &\le \bar p_i(t) & &\text{irradiance ceiling}\\
p_i^{\mathrm{curt}} &= \bar p_i(t) - p_i^{G} \;\ge\; 0 & &\text{curtailment}\\
\cos\theta_l\; p_i^{G} + \sin\theta_l\; q_i^{G} &\in [-S_i^{\max},\, S_i^{\max}],
   \quad \theta_l = \tfrac{l\pi}{16},\; l = 1,\dots,16 & &\text{capability polygon}\\
q_i^{G} &= q_i\!\left(v_{b(i)}^{\varphi(i)}\right) & &\text{the droop}\\[2pt]
\min \; & \textstyle\sum_{i,t} p_i^{\mathrm{curt}} & &\text{objective}
\end{aligned} \tag{29}
```

The last two lines are the whole point of the page: ``q_i(\cdot)`` is the IEEE 1547 curve,
encoded exactly by Big-M, Lambda/SOS2 or Heaviside, and ``v_{b(i)}^{\varphi(i)}`` is the
one scalar each host has to supply.

### Host A: LinDist3Flow

The multiphase form of the LinDistFlow linearisation [[3]](#ref-3), from Gan and
Low [[12]](#ref-12). Each line carries a 3×3 phase impedance ``Z`` rather than a scalar,
and the phases couple. Starting from ``\lvert V_j\rvert^2 = \lvert V_i - Z I\rvert^2``,
dropping the quadratic term and assuming voltages stay near-balanced gives, per phase
``\varphi``:

```math
w_j^{\varphi} = w_i^{\varphi} - \sum_{\psi} \Big( a^R_{\varphi\psi} P_{ij}^{\psi}
                                               + a^X_{\varphi\psi} Q_{ij}^{\psi} \Big),
\qquad
\begin{aligned}
a^R_{\varphi\psi} &= 2\,\mathrm{Re}\!\left(\alpha^{\psi-\varphi} Z_{\varphi\psi}\right)\\
a^X_{\varphi\psi} &= 2\,\mathrm{Im}\!\left(\alpha^{\psi-\varphi} Z_{\varphi\psi}\right)
\end{aligned} \tag{30}
```

with ``\alpha = e^{-j2\pi/3}`` the 120° rotation. The ``\pm\sqrt{3}`` cross-terms in the
published form of these matrices are that rotation written out. Two checks are worth
carrying: for a single phase ``\alpha^0 = 1`` gives ``a^R = 2r`` and ``a^X = 2x``,
recovering ``w_j = w_i - 2(rP + xQ)``; and for diagonal ``Z`` the matrices are diagonal
and the phases decouple into three independent LinDistFlows.

The implementation works in magnitude rather than squared magnitude
(``w_j - w_i \approx 2 V^{\mathrm{nom}}(v_j - v_i)`` near nominal) so that the droop
breakpoints stay in ordinary p.u. voltage. That done, the complete host is four
equations — power balance per bus *and* per phase, the coupled drop, the slack, and the
voltage limits:

```math
\begin{aligned}
v_0^{\varphi} &= V^{\mathrm{nom}} & &\forall \varphi \in \Psi\\
p_j^{G,\varphi} - p_j^{L,\varphi} &= \sum_{k:(j,k)\in\mathcal{L}} P_{jk}^{\varphi}
                                   - \sum_{i:(i,j)\in\mathcal{L}} P_{ij}^{\varphi}
                                   & &\forall j \in \mathcal{B},\ \varphi \in \Psi\\
q_j^{G,\varphi} - q_j^{L,\varphi} &= \sum_{k:(j,k)\in\mathcal{L}} Q_{jk}^{\varphi}
                                   - \sum_{i:(i,j)\in\mathcal{L}} Q_{ij}^{\varphi}
                                   & &\forall j \in \mathcal{B},\ \varphi \in \Psi\\
v_j^{\varphi} &= v_i^{\varphi} - \sum_{\psi \in \Psi} \Big( \tilde a^R_{\varphi\psi} P_{ij}^{\psi}
                                       + \tilde a^X_{\varphi\psi} Q_{ij}^{\psi} \Big)
                                   & &\forall (i,j) \in \mathcal{L},\ \varphi \in \Psi\\
V^{\min} &\le v_j^{\varphi} \le V^{\max} & &\forall j \in \mathcal{B},\ \varphi \in \Psi
\end{aligned} \tag{31}
```

with ``\Psi = \{a,b,c\}`` the phase set, ``\varphi`` and ``\psi`` phases within it, and
``\tilde a = a / (2V^{\mathrm{nom}})`` the magnitude-form coefficients. Note what is
*absent*: there is no current variable and no loss term. That is exactly what buys the
linearity, and exactly what it costs.

```julia
# 3×3 drop coefficients, once per line
const ALPHA = exp(-2π * im / 3)
function drop_matrices(Z)                      # Z is 3×3, per unit
    aR = zeros(3, 3); aX = zeros(3, 3)
    for p in 1:3, q in 1:3
        c = ALPHA^(p - q) * conj(Z[p, q])
        aR[p, q] = 2 * real(c); aX[p, q] = -2 * imag(c)
    end
    return aR ./ (2 * VNOM), aX ./ (2 * VNOM)    # magnitude form
end

@variable(model, VLIM[1] <= v[1:nb, PHASES, 1:T] <= VLIM[2])   # voltage limits

    v[bus_id[BR[k].to], φ, t] == v[bus_id[BR[k].from], φ, t]
        - sum(AR[k][φ, ψ] * P[k, ψ, t] + AX[k][φ, ψ] * Q[k, ψ, t] for ψ in PHASES))

# power balance, per bus AND per phase; losses neglected
@constraint(model, [b in 1:nb, φ in PHASES, t in 1:T],
    netP[b, φ, t] == sum(P[k, φ, t] for k in out_br[b]; init = zero(AffExpr))
                   - sum(P[k, φ, t] for k in in_br[b];  init = zero(AffExpr)))
@constraint(model, [b in 1:nb, φ in PHASES, t in 1:T],
    netQ[b, φ, t] == sum(Q[k, φ, t] for k in out_br[b]; init = zero(AffExpr))
                   - sum(Q[k, φ, t] for k in in_br[b];  init = zero(AffExpr)))
```

where `netP`/`netQ` collect the substation injection, the inverters at that bus and phase,
and the local load.

### Host B: three-phase IVACOPF

The **current-voltage AC optimal power flow** of Soltani, Khorsand and Ma [[4]](#ref-4),
in its native three-phase unbalanced form — the setting the paper was written for. Its
appeal here is structural. Write the network in rectangular current and voltage
coordinates and the *line* equations become exactly linear, mutual coupling and all; the
only nonlinearity left is the ``v \cdot I`` power balance and the voltage magnitude, and
both live at the **buses**. In a distribution feeder the buses are the endpoints and the
lines are everything else, so this confines the nonlinearity to a small, well-behaved part
of the model instead of spreading it along every branch, as a power-voltage formulation
does.

The formulation is that of Soltani, Khorsand and Ma [[4]](#ref-4); the equations are
numbered here in this tutorial's own sequence. Bus set ``\Upsilon``, phase set
``\Psi = \{a,b,c\}`` with phases indexed ``\varphi`` and ``p``; the time index
``t \in \{1,\dots,96\}`` is suppressed throughout.

**Line current constraints.** For the line from ``n`` to ``m``, with 3×3
impedance ``Z_{nm}^{\varphi p} = R_{nm}^{\varphi p} + jX_{nm}^{\varphi p}`` and shunt
admittance ``y_{nm}^{p,k}``:

```math
V_n^{\varphi} - V_m^{\varphi} = \sum_{p\in\Psi} Z_{nm}^{\varphi p} I_{nm}^{p}
   \;-\; \tfrac{1}{2}\sum_{p\in\Psi} Z_{nm}^{\varphi p}
          \Big( \sum_{k\in\Psi} y_{nm}^{p,k} V_n^{k} \Big),
\qquad \forall \varphi \in \Psi \tag{32}
```

Three physical contributions, in two sums: the current in the same phase (the ``p = \varphi``
term), the currents in the *other* phases reaching this one through the mutual impedances,
and the shunt current. Splitting (32) into real and imaginary parts gives, for the
Kron-reduced three-wire feeders used here — where ``y = 0``,

```math
\begin{aligned}
v_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi} - v_m^{\mathrm{re},\varphi}
  &= \sum_{p\in\Psi}\Big( R_{nm}^{\varphi p} I_{nm}^{\mathrm{re},p}
                        - X_{nm}^{\varphi p} I_{nm}^{\mathrm{im},p} \Big)\\
v_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi} - v_m^{\mathrm{im},\varphi}
  &= \sum_{p\in\Psi}\Big( R_{nm}^{\varphi p} I_{nm}^{\mathrm{im},p}
                        + X_{nm}^{\varphi p} I_{nm}^{\mathrm{re},p} \Big)
\end{aligned}
\qquad \forall (n,m) \in \mathcal{L},\ \varphi \in \Psi \tag{33}
```

These are **exact and linear**. No rotation operator appears, nothing is transposed, and
no near-balance is assumed anywhere — compare the ``\alpha^{\psi-\varphi}`` of
LinDist3Flow, which is precisely where that host's balanced-voltage assumption enters.

**Bus current injection** — KCL, per bus and phase, also exact and linear:

```math
I_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi} = \sum_{m:(n,m)\in\mathcal{L}} I_{nm}^{\mathrm{re},\varphi}
                          - \sum_{k:(k,n)\in\mathcal{L}} I_{kn}^{\mathrm{re},\varphi},
\qquad
I_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi} = \sum_{m:(n,m)\in\mathcal{L}} I_{nm}^{\mathrm{im},\varphi}
                          - \sum_{k:(k,n)\in\mathcal{L}} I_{kn}^{\mathrm{im},\varphi} \tag{34}
```

**Power balance** — the first of the two nonlinear relations:

```math
\begin{aligned}
p_n^{G,\varphi} - p_n^{L,\varphi}
   &= v_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi} I_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi}
    + v_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi} I_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi}\\
q_n^{G,\varphi} - q_n^{L,\varphi}
   &= v_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi} I_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi}
    - v_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi} I_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi}
\end{aligned}
\qquad \forall n \in \Upsilon,\ \varphi \in \Psi \tag{35}
```

**Linearised power balance.** Each product ``xy`` in (35) is replaced by its first-order
Taylor expansion about the previous iterate, ``xy \approx x^{\circ}y + y^{\circ}x -
x^{\circ}y^{\circ}``, where ``\circ`` marks a value **fixed from the previous pass** — a
constant, not a variable:

```math
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{P}_n^{\varphi} &:= v_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi\circ} I_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi}
   + I_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi\circ} v_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi}
   + v_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi\circ} I_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi}
   + I_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi\circ} v_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi}
   - v_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi\circ} I_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi\circ}
   - v_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi\circ} I_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi\circ}\\
\mathcal{Q}_n^{\varphi} &:= v_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi\circ} I_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi}
   + I_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi\circ} v_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi}
   - v_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi\circ} I_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi}
   - I_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi\circ} v_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi}
   - v_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi\circ} I_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi\circ}
   + v_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi\circ} I_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi\circ}
\end{aligned} \tag{36}
```

which are then set equal to the net injection at each class of bus:

```math
\begin{aligned}
p_0^{\mathrm{grid},\varphi} &= \mathcal{P}_0^{\varphi}, &
q_0^{\mathrm{grid},\varphi} &= \mathcal{Q}_0^{\varphi} & &\text{substation}\\
-p_n^{L,\varphi} &= \mathcal{P}_n^{\varphi}, &
-q_n^{L,\varphi} &= \mathcal{Q}_n^{\varphi} & &\text{load-only bus and phase}\\
p_i^{G} - p_n^{L,\varphi} &= \mathcal{P}_n^{\varphi}, &
q_i^{G} - q_n^{L,\varphi} &= \mathcal{Q}_n^{\varphi} & &\text{inverter } i \text{ at } (n,\varphi)
\end{aligned} \tag{37}
```

The last line is where the droop enters the network: ``q_i^{G}`` is exactly the variable
the three encodings constrain.

**Voltage magnitude, and its linearisation** — the second nonlinear relation, and the
single quantity the droop module reads:

```math
v_n^{\varphi} = \sqrt{\big(v_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi}\big)^2 + \big(v_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi}\big)^2}
\;\;\longrightarrow\;\;
v_n^{\varphi} = \frac{v_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi\circ}}
   {\sqrt{\big(v_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi\circ}\big)^2 + \big(v_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi\circ}\big)^2}}\, v_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi}
 + \frac{v_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi\circ}}
   {\sqrt{\big(v_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi\circ}\big)^2 + \big(v_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi\circ}\big)^2}}\, v_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi} \tag{38}
```

**Voltage limits.** The band every bus and phase must stay inside:

```math
V^{\min} \le v_n^{\varphi} \le V^{\max},
\qquad \forall n \in \Upsilon,\ \varphi \in \Psi \tag{39}
```

**Thermal line limits.** The conductor rating, per line and phase:

```math
\big(I_{nm}^{\mathrm{re},\varphi}\big)^2 + \big(I_{nm}^{\mathrm{im},\varphi}\big)^2
   \le \big(I_{nm}^{\max,\varphi}\big)^2,
\qquad \forall (n,m) \in \mathcal{L},\ \varphi \in \Psi \tag{40}
```

Constraint (40) is worth pausing on: IVACOPF carries the line current as a decision
variable, so a thermal limit is something you simply *write*. LinDist3Flow has no ``I`` to
write it about. It is quadratic, so the scripts offer it as a polygon inscribing the circle
— keeping the model an MILP — and leave it off by default, because on these Electricity
North West (ENWL) feeders
the peak flow is about a fifth of the conductor rating; the loading is reported either way.

**Slack reference.** The three-phase substation, which is also the flat start:

```math
v_0^{\mathrm{re},\varphi} = \cos\theta_{\varphi},\quad
v_0^{\mathrm{im},\varphi} = \sin\theta_{\varphi},
\qquad \theta = (0°,\, -120°,\, +120°) \tag{41}
```

Seeding all three phases at ``1\angle 0°`` instead is a silent and expensive mistake: the
mutual terms then add rather than largely cancelling.

**Convergence.** After each pass, the linearisation error is measured against the *true*
nonlinear relations — not against the model's own residual. Following [[4]](#ref-4), three
metrics are used: the **maximum absolute active power balance** error (MAPB), the
**maximum absolute reactive power balance** error (MRPB), and the **maximum
voltage-magnitude** error (MVM). Writing (35) minus (36) and (38) exact minus linearised,

```math
\begin{aligned}
\text{MAPB} &= \max_{n\in\Upsilon,\,\varphi\in\Psi}
   \Big| \big(v_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi} I_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi}
            + v_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi} I_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi}\big)
         - \mathcal{P}_n^{\varphi} \Big|\\
\text{MRPB} &= \max_{n\in\Upsilon,\,\varphi\in\Psi}
   \Big| \big(v_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi} I_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi}
            - v_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi} I_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi}\big)
         - \mathcal{Q}_n^{\varphi} \Big|\\
\text{MVM} &= \max_{n\in\Upsilon,\,\varphi\in\Psi}
   \Big| \sqrt{\big(v_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi}\big)^2 + \big(v_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi}\big)^2}
         - v_n^{\varphi} \Big|
\end{aligned} \tag{42}
```

the loop repeats with a refreshed ``\circ`` point until
``\max(\text{MAPB}, \text{MRPB}, \text{MVM}) < \epsilon``, here ``10^{-6}``. Checking
against the true relations is what makes the converged point a genuine power-flow solution
rather than a solution of the approximation — and the audit further down confirms it
independently.

```

#### Where the loop starts

A flat start (``1\angle0°,\,1\angle{-120°},\,1\angle{+120°}`` with all currents zero) is
what the paper prescribes and what the scripts fall back to with `TP_WARMSTART=flat`. By
default they do something cheaper to converge from: one exact three-phase
backward/forward sweep per time step, at full PV and zero VArs, which costs a few seconds
and hands the first linearisation a physically consistent state instead of a guess. This
is the three-phase analogue of the package's `warm_start = :lindistflow`, and the same
sweep is reused afterwards to audit the answer.

### What actually changes for the droop: one index

Here is the whole three-phase interface, in every encoding:

```julia
vpv(i, t) = v[PV[i].bus, PV[i].phase, t]     # the voltage inverter i actually senses
```

A single-phase inverter connected line-to-neutral senses the voltage of *its own phase at
its own bus*. Nothing in Big-M, Lambda or Heaviside cares whether that terminal is
identified by a bus, or by a bus and a phase. Each asks the host for one scalar voltage
variable, and constrains one scalar reactive output against it.

That is why the three droop blocks below are the same algebra as their single-phase
counterparts, with `v[d,h,m]` replaced by `vpv(i,t)` — and why the *same* three blocks
drop unchanged into either host. In LinDist3Flow `v` is a decision variable directly; in
IVACOPF it is the linearised magnitude (38). The droop neither knows nor cares.

**Lambda / SOS2** — weights shared between the sensed voltage and the reactive output:

```julia
@variable(model, λ[1:6, 1:npv, 1:T] >= 0)
@variable(model, z[1:5, 1:npv, 1:T], Bin)

@constraint(model, [i in 1:npv, t in 1:T], sum(λ[j, i, t] for j in 1:6) == 1)
@constraint(model, [i in 1:npv, t in 1:T], sum(z[j, i, t] for j in 1:5) == 1)
@constraint(model, [i in 1:npv, t in 1:T], λ[1, i, t] <= z[1, i, t])
@constraint(model, [j in 2:5, i in 1:npv, t in 1:T], λ[j, i, t] <= z[j-1, i, t] + z[j, i, t])
@constraint(model, [i in 1:npv, t in 1:T], λ[6, i, t] <= z[5, i, t])

@constraint(model, [i in 1:npv, t in 1:T], vpv(i, t) == sum(λ[j,i,t] * VBP[j] for j in 1:6))
@constraint(model, [i in 1:npv, t in 1:T],
    Qdg[i, t] == sum(λ[j,i,t] * QSHAPE[j] * PV[i].Smax for j in 1:6))
```

**Big-M** — one binary per segment, with ``W = \delta v`` linearising the products:

```julia
Mbig = 1.1
@variable(model, δ[1:5, 1:npv, 1:T], Bin)
@variable(model, W2[1:npv, 1:T]); @variable(model, W4[1:npv, 1:T])

@constraint(model, [i in 1:npv, t in 1:T], sum(δ[j, i, t] for j in 1:5) == 1)

for (j, lo, hi) in ((1, 1, 2), (3, 3, 4), (5, 5, 6))          # flat segments
    @constraint(model, [i in 1:npv, t in 1:T], vpv(i,t) >= VBP[lo] - Mbig * (1 - δ[j,i,t]))
    @constraint(model, [i in 1:npv, t in 1:T], vpv(i,t) <= VBP[hi] + Mbig * (1 - δ[j,i,t]))
end
for (j, W, lo, hi) in ((2, W2, 2, 3), (4, W4, 4, 5))          # sloped segments
    @constraint(model, [i in 1:npv, t in 1:T], vpv(i,t) - W[i,t] >= -Mbig * (1 - δ[j,i,t]))
    @constraint(model, [i in 1:npv, t in 1:T], vpv(i,t) - W[i,t] <=  Mbig * (1 - δ[j,i,t]))
    @constraint(model, [i in 1:npv, t in 1:T], W[i,t] >= VBP[lo] * δ[j,i,t])
    @constraint(model, [i in 1:npv, t in 1:T], W[i,t] <= VBP[hi] * δ[j,i,t])
end

@constraint(model, [i in 1:npv, t in 1:T],
    Qdg[i,t] == δ[1,i,t] * PV[i].Smax
              + W2[i,t] * (-PV[i].Smax / (VBP[3] - VBP[2]))
              + δ[2,i,t] * (PV[i].Smax * VBP[3] / (VBP[3] - VBP[2]))
              + W4[i,t] * (-PV[i].Smax / (VBP[5] - VBP[4]))
              + δ[4,i,t] * (PV[i].Smax * VBP[4] / (VBP[5] - VBP[4]))
              - δ[5,i,t] * PV[i].Smax)
```

**Heaviside** — one closed-form masked sum, no new variables at all:

```julia
Hstep(x) = op_ifelse(op_greater_than_or_equal_to(x, 0), 1.0, 0.0)

@constraint(model, [i in 1:npv, t in 1:T],
    Qdg[i,t] ==
        PV[i].Smax * (Hstep(vpv(i,t) - VBP[1]) - Hstep(vpv(i,t) - VBP[2]))
      + (-PV[i].Smax / (VBP[3] - VBP[2])) * (vpv(i,t) - VBP[3]) *
            (Hstep(vpv(i,t) - VBP[2]) - Hstep(vpv(i,t) - VBP[3]))
      + (-PV[i].Smax / (VBP[5] - VBP[4])) * (vpv(i,t) - VBP[4]) *
            (Hstep(vpv(i,t) - VBP[4]) - Hstep(vpv(i,t) - VBP[5]))
      - PV[i].Smax * (Hstep(vpv(i,t) - VBP[5]) - Hstep(vpv(i,t) - VBP[6])))
```

Compare these with Methods A, B and C above: the algebra is identical. What has grown is
the *count* — the binaries in Big-M and Lambda now scale with inverters × time steps on a
feeder that may carry a single-phase inverter at every service connection, which is where
the integer-free encoding starts to look attractive.

### A mixed fleet makes the curves visible

The case study puts twelve inverters on a real unbalanced low-voltage (LV) feeder — 194 buses,
eighteen single-phase loads split four, five and nine across the phases — in **four size
classes**. Because ``\bar q = S_{\max}``, the four classes follow four *different* droop
curves: same breakpoint voltages, four saturation levels. Each phase carries one inverter
of each class.

**Table 15.** The four inverter size classes of the three-phase case study. Because ``\bar q = S_{\max}``, each class follows a different droop curve.

```@example tut
tp_class_table()   # hide
```

```@example tut
tp_droop_figure()   # hide
```

**Figure 8.** Three-phase dispatch against the droop, LinDist3Flow host. Four classes, four curves; a point is correct only if it lies on the curve of its own inverter.

```@example tut
tp_droop_figure("lambda"; res = tpi, host = "IVACOPF")   # hide
```

**Figure 9.** The same fleet on the IVACOPF host. The points sit at different places along the curves, because the two hosts predict different terminal voltages, but never off them.

Drawn in absolute p.u. VArs, because normalising by ``\bar q`` would collapse the four
classes onto one line and hide the thing worth checking: a dispatch point is correct only
if it lies on the curve belonging to *its own inverter*. All three encodings put every
point on the right curve, to solver tolerance, **on both hosts** — the same result as
single-phase, on networks that are unbalanced, multiphase and carrying a mixed fleet.

Figures 8 and 9 are not identical, and the difference is instructive: the points sit at
different *places along* the curves, because the two hosts predict different terminal
voltages. They are never off the curves. Which set of places is the real one is settled
by the audit in [What the exact power flow says](@ref).

The phases behave differently, which is the whole reason for modelling them separately:

```@example tut
tp_envelope_figure()   # hide
```

**Figure 10.** Voltage envelope by phase, LinDist3Flow host. The three phases do not coincide, which is the reason for modelling them separately.

```@example tut
tp_envelope_figure("lambda"; res = tpi, host = "IVACOPF")   # hide
```

**Figure 11.** Voltage envelope by phase, IVACOPF host.

### The two hosts, side by side

Six runs: three encodings on each of two hosts, everything else held fixed.

**Table 16.** Three encodings on each of two three-phase hosts, everything else held fixed. Passes is 1 for the linear host, which has no outer loop.

```@example tut
tp_host_table()   # hide
```

Read Table 16 in two directions. **Down each host block**, the three encodings agree — same
curtailment, same losses, same voltage range — which is the three-phase restatement of the
single-phase result that these are three encodings of one curve. **Across the two blocks**,
the hosts do not agree, and that difference is the network model's alone.

The gap is about 3.6 kWh, some 8 % of the curtailed energy, and it runs the *opposite* way
from the single-phase case: here it is LinDist3Flow that curtails more. There is no
paradox and no general rule — the direction depends on the feeder. What does carry over is
the mechanism. LinDist3Flow drops losses from the balance entirely; IVACOPF measures them
at 14.6 kWh over the day, about 3 % of the available PV energy, and having them in the
model changes which dispatch clears the voltage band. A host that cannot represent losses
cannot be expected to agree with one that can, in either direction.

The droop is reproduced exactly in every one of the six:

**Table 17.** Exactness of the encoding within each host: the largest gap between dispatched reactive power and the curve at the voltage that host reports.

```@example tut
tp_exact_table()   # hide
```

That is the separation this section exists to make. **Exactness of the encoding is a
property of the encoding; accuracy is a property of the host.** Every cell above is at
round-off — the inverters sit on their curves *within whatever model they are placed in* —
and Table 17 says nothing whatever about whether that model is right.

### What the exact power flow says

To decide between the hosts you have to stop asking either model about itself. Take each
solved dispatch, put it through an **exact three-phase backward/forward sweep**, and ask
what the inverters would really have seen (Table 18):

**Table 18.** The exact-power-flow audit. Each solved dispatch is re-solved with a full three-phase backward/forward sweep, and compared against what the host predicted.

```@example tut
tp_audit_table()   # hide
```

```@example tut
tp_host_envelope_figure()   # hide

**Figure 12.** The two hosts' envelopes on one axis: same feeder, same dispatch problem, and a visible offset that is entirely the network model's doing.

This is the same test the single-phase section applies to LinDistFlow and IVACOPF, and it
returns the same verdict on a harder network.

The IVACOPF dispatch reproduces the exact AC solution to about ``2\times10^{-11}`` p.u., so
the voltage each inverter was told to read *is* the voltage it would see, and the droop
residual survives the transfer intact — it stays at round-off. The LinDist3Flow dispatch
does not. Its voltages are off by ``1.3\times10^{-3}`` p.u., which sounds harmless until
you put it through the curve: the upper segment falls a full ``\bar q`` across 0.02 p.u.,
a slope of ``50\,\bar q`` per p.u. of voltage, so

```math
1.3\times10^{-3}\;\text{p.u. of voltage} \;\times\; 50\,\bar q
   \;=\; 0.065\,\bar q \;\approx\; 8\times10^{-3}\ \text{p.u. of VArs}
```

which is exactly the measured residual, and **about 6 % of that inverter's reactive
rating**. The inverters would not produce the VArs the model dispatched. A steep local
control law is an error amplifier, and it is the host that decides what gets amplified.

One difference from the single-phase case is worth recording rather than glossing: here
*neither* host violates a voltage limit — the band is simply not binding on this feeder —
so LinDist3Flow's failure is confined to the droop residual. On the 33-bus feeder it was
both, with seventeen quarter-hours below the lower limit as well. The failure mode is not
guaranteed to announce itself in a constraint violation, which is precisely why the audit
is worth running.

None of this is a defect of the droop block, and none of it is fixed by choosing a
different encoding. It is the price of dropping losses from the balance and of the
near-balanced-voltage assumption behind the ``a^R``, ``a^X`` coefficients — an assumption
that is *least* true on exactly the kind of unbalanced LV feeder where single-phase
inverters matter.

### What each host costs

**Table 19.** Successive-linearisation passes for the three-phase IVACOPF host, Lambda encoding, measured with the error metrics of (42).

```@example tut
tp_pass_table()   # hide
```

Three passes, and the error metrics fall by roughly three orders of magnitude each time —
the behaviour you would expect of a Taylor expansion refreshed about its own solution.
The objective moves by 5 % between the first and second pass and by ``5\times10^{-5}`` between
the second and third, so the first pass alone would have been meaningfully wrong and the
third is essentially free insurance. All three encodings take the same three passes, and
their first two passes agree to three significant figures on every metric — by the third
they are all far below tolerance and what separates them is solver noise. The outer loop
belongs to the host, not to the droop.

Note the second column of Table 19: **each pass is a complete MILP** (or NLP), so IVACOPF
costs one LinDist3Flow-sized solve per pass — on a model rather more than twice the size —
times the number of passes, plus a few seconds of warm-start sweeps. That is the whole of
the price, and Table 18 is what it buys.

**Table 20.** What changes between the two three-phase hosts.

| | LinDist3Flow | IVACOPF (3-phase) |
|:--|:--|:--|
| line equations | approximate — ``\alpha``-rotated drop coefficients, near-balance assumed | **exact** — ``\Delta V = ZI`` with full mutual coupling, nothing assumed |
| losses | dropped from the balance | modelled, via the current variables |
| line currents | not represented | decision variables, so the thermal limit (40) is writable |
| nonlinearity | none | two bus relations, ``v\cdot I`` and ``\lvert v\rvert``, linearised and iterated |
| solve | **one pass** | one MILP (or NLP) **per pass**, plus warm-start sweeps |
| dispatch on the real network | off the droop by a visible margin | on the droop to round-off |

The trade is the usual one, and it is the host's trade, not the encodings'. LinDist3Flow
is the right tool for a fast first look, for screening, and — as the single-phase section
shows — for warm-starting the accurate model. **Use IVACOPF for anything quantitative.**

### Does it scale?

The encodings are cheap to state; the question is whether they survive a network worth
calling realistic. The three LinDist3Flow scripts were run unchanged on a second real feeder from
the same ENWL family — `network_17_Feeder_6` [[15]](#ref-15), **3856 buses, 3855 lines,
223 single-phase loads**, twenty times the first one — by setting an environment variable:

```bash
TP_CASE=network_17_Feeder_6 julia --project=examples/three_phase     examples/three_phase/LinDist3Flow_Lambda.jl
```

**Table 21.** Scalability of the three encodings on the LinDist3Flow host, across a 194-bus and a 3856-bus feeder.

```@example tut
tp_scale_table()   # hide
```

Two things to take from this.

**The mixed-integer encodings scale.** Big-M and Lambda both carry a 3.3-million-variable
model over the full 96-step day and solve it in about a minute — roughly twelve times the
small feeder's solve for eighteen times the network, and the droop is still reproduced to
solver tolerance. The binary count does not move at all between the two feeders, because
it depends on inverters × time steps and not on network size. That is the useful property:
**enlarging the network grows the linear part of the problem, not the combinatorial part.**

**The integer-free encoding does not.** Heaviside is the cheapest of the three by variable
count — it adds nothing to the model — and it is comfortably the most expensive to solve.
On the small feeder it costs several times Lambda. On the large one at the full horizon
Ipopt gives up with `ERROR`; shortening the day to twelve steps brings it back to a
model an eighth the size, which then solves — in minutes rather than the seconds the
mixed-integer encodings need, but it solves, and the last row of Table 21 records what
comes back. The non-smoothness that costs nothing to write costs a great deal to
differentiate, and it is what limits this encoding long before the network does.

**And when it does finish, it is still exact.** That reduced-horizon run reproduces the
droop to ``7\times10^{-16}`` — round-off — on a 3856-bus feeder, which is the whole point
of separating the two failure modes. Heaviside's difficulty is *convergence*, not
correctness: the encoding never approximates the curve, it only makes the solver work
harder to find the point on it. A row that reads "slow" and a row that reads "wrong" are
very different results, and this one is the first.

None of this changes which encoding is *correct* — all three reproduce the curve exactly,
here as before. It changes which one you would reach for on a feeder with an inverter at
every service connection.

The sweep is run on LinDist3Flow, because it is the host that isolates the *encodings’*
scaling: one solve each, no outer loop, so what Table 21 measures is the cost of the droop
block and nothing else. IVACOPF multiplies every row by its pass count — three passes on the
case study — on top of a larger model per pass, but the binary counts, which are the thing
at issue here, are identical in both hosts.

The sweep runs one process per row, separately from the case study above, so its timings
will not match that table to the second. Read both as orders of magnitude, as the warning
further up says.

### Running it

Every host × encoding pair has its own standalone script in
[`examples/three_phase/`](https://github.com/ra-emami/SmartInverterDOPF.jl/tree/main/examples/three_phase).
All six share their skeleton — data, PV placement, verification, figures — verbatim; a
`diff` between any two shows only the droop block, or only the network model:

**Table 22.** The six three-phase example scripts, one per host and encoding.

| | Big-M | Lambda / SOS2 | Heaviside |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **LinDist3Flow** | [`LinDist3Flow_BigM.jl`](https://github.com/ra-emami/SmartInverterDOPF.jl/blob/main/examples/three_phase/LinDist3Flow_BigM.jl) | [`LinDist3Flow_Lambda.jl`](https://github.com/ra-emami/SmartInverterDOPF.jl/blob/main/examples/three_phase/LinDist3Flow_Lambda.jl) | [`LinDist3Flow_Heaviside.jl`](https://github.com/ra-emami/SmartInverterDOPF.jl/blob/main/examples/three_phase/LinDist3Flow_Heaviside.jl) |
| **IVACOPF** | [`IVACOPF3Ph_BigM.jl`](https://github.com/ra-emami/SmartInverterDOPF.jl/blob/main/examples/three_phase/IVACOPF3Ph_BigM.jl) | [`IVACOPF3Ph_Lambda.jl`](https://github.com/ra-emami/SmartInverterDOPF.jl/blob/main/examples/three_phase/IVACOPF3Ph_Lambda.jl) | [`IVACOPF3Ph_Heaviside.jl`](https://github.com/ra-emami/SmartInverterDOPF.jl/blob/main/examples/three_phase/IVACOPF3Ph_Heaviside.jl) |

The Big-M and Lambda scripts need an MILP solver (Gurobi); the Heaviside ones need only
Ipopt.

```bash
julia --project=examples/three_phase examples/three_phase/IVACOPF3Ph_Lambda.jl
```

Each reads its feeder, horizon and fleet from the environment, so the same model runs on a
different network without touching the code:

**Table 23.** Environment overrides accepted by every three-phase script.

| variable | default | meaning |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `TP_CASE` | `network_5_Feeder_2` | ENWL feeder to load |
| `TP_STEPS` | `96` | time steps in the day |
| `TP_NPV` | `4` | smart inverters per phase |
| `TP_WARMSTART` | `sweep` | IVACOPF only — `flat` for the paper's flat start |
| `TP_TOL` | `1e-6` | IVACOPF only — stop tolerance on max(MAPB, MRPB, MVM) |
| `TP_MAXITER` | `15` | IVACOPF only — pass limit |
| `TP_IMAXSEG` | `0` | IVACOPF only — sides of the polygon enforcing (40); 0 disables it |

```bash
TP_CASE=network_17_Feeder_6 TP_STEPS=24 julia --project=examples/three_phase examples/three_phase/IVACOPF3Ph_Lambda.jl
```


## Reproducing these results

The figures and tables on this page are drawn from results committed to the repository,
so building the documentation needs no solver. To regenerate them:

```bash
julia --project=scripts scripts/generate_results.jl
```

and, for the three-phase section — which runs all six scripts, both hosts:

```bash
julia --project=examples/three_phase examples/three_phase/generate_results.jl
```

`TP_HOSTS=ivacopf` or `TP_HOSTS=lindist3flow` regenerates just one family. The scalability
table has its own sweep, which shells out to the scripts one per process:

```bash
julia --project=examples/three_phase examples/three_phase/scalability.jl
```

That runs all three methods with Gurobi and Ipopt and rewrites
`docs/src/assets/results/`. To run a single method yourself:

```julia
using SmartInverterDOPF, Gurobi

case = load_case()
res  = solve_dopf(case, Gurobi.Optimizer; method = :lambda)

println("curtailed: ", round(kWh(case, sum(res.PVC)), digits = 2), " kWh")
println("voltage:   ", round(minimum(res.V), digits = 4), " – ",
                       round(maximum(res.V), digits = 4), " p.u.")
```

Swap `:lambda` for `:bigm` or `:heaviside`; the latter needs an NLP solver such as
`Ipopt.Optimizer`.

## Takeaways

**Embedding is a correctness requirement, not a refinement.** Smart inverters follow
their curve, not a set-point — that is what IEEE Std 1547-2018 [[1]](#ref-1) obliges them
to do. Only a droop-aware OPF returns a dispatch the fleet will actually deliver.

**Two exact families, one curve.** Integer encodings (Big-M, Lambda/SOS2) give an MILP;
non-smooth algebra (Heaviside) gives an NLP. All three reproduce the curve to
round-off and return the same dispatch. The choice is which solver world you want to
work in.

**The host is a separate decision, and it is the one that decides accuracy.** All three
encodings are exact *within* whatever model they sit in — single-phase or three-phase,
linear or near-exact. What the model resembles is the host's business: on the unbalanced
LV feeder here, LinDist3Flow and IVACOPF put the same inverters on the same curves and
still disagree about the answer, and only the exact power flow settles which to believe.
Pick the encoding for the solver you have; pick the host for the accuracy you need.

**Scale picks the method.** Binaries multiply with inverters × time steps, which is what
eventually breaks the MILP route on large fleets. The integer-free encoding avoids that
but hands the difficulty to the NLP solver, where non-smoothness shows up as degraded
convergence — visible here in a first pass that stops at `ALMOST_LOCALLY_SOLVED`.
